## Starting to use Obsidian
I'm thinking about giving Obsidian a serious try. Instead of replacing Joplin I will add Obsidian as another layer. I'll use Joplin to make all kind of notes:
	- book notes while reading
	- article notes
	- Bookmarks Manager
	
After making all the notes in Joplin, if the note is good enough it will make it hear. 


## Working with Joplin
I still want to work on my small side hustle project where I take the content of Joplin notebooks and help people render it to valid Markdown and optionally publish it as a Static Website.  Just for the purpose of the link building, I want to mention that the project is built with Python and I want t build a desktop application on top of it, with Electron.js

## Journaling
I wonder if I should be doing my daily journaling here or in Joplin. I think Obsidian should work nicely, since we have a way to automatically create daily notes. Additionally, I can follow [[Derek Sivers]] suggestion to keep journal on various topics, this should fit in nicely. By leaving my notes in the specific themed note, I might be able to see some sort of connection in the future. We'll see, I know for a fact the system will evolve greatly.

I'm still in the process of reading [[How to Take Smart Notes 202010131439]] by [[Sönke Ahrens]] and [[How to Read a Book 202010131541]] by [[Mortimer Adler]].
