> Goals restrict your happiness. The implicit assumption behind any goal is this: “Once I reach my goal, then I’ll be happy.”

When it comes to big goals, they are often counter productive, or at the very least not the best way to approach life in the long term. The assumption here is that the big goal (Earn 100K) is tied to your happiness level, which makes you unhappy until you reach that goal. Also, when you reach that goal, you will be happy for a second, then will create another goal, and now we are back to being unhappy.

Creating good habits is a much better way to reach your goals, while staying happy.
