> Also, metacognitive abilities, or the ability of being self-aware, tends to be possible only at the higher skill levels. Unfortunately, this means practitioners at the lower skill levels have a marked tendency to overestimate their own abilities—by as much as 50 percent, as it turns out. According to a study in [[Unskilled and Unaware of It - How Diffculties in Recognizing One’s Own Incompetence Lead to Infated Self-Assessments]] \[KD99\], the only path to a more correct self-assessment is to improve the individual’s skill level, which in turn increases metacognitive ability.

Beginners are overestimating their skill level, due to the [[Dunning-Kruger effect]]. With more skill comes the ability to self-asses.
