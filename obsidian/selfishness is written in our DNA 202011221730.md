> [[Richard Dawkins]] said in [[The Selfish Gene]]: "Be warned that if you wish, as I do, to build a society in which individuals cooperate generously and unselfishly towards a common good, you can expect little help from biological nature. Let us try to teach generosity and altruism, because we are born selfish.

It is built in into our DNA to be selfish, and only a fool will assume a person's desire to share. Generosity and Altruism need to be taught.
