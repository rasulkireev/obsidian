[[The Importance of Launching 202012031712]]

> It’s a massive differentiator to have launched something. To have had an idea, and put it into the world. Even at Google I realized - most people I worked with had never actually put their own ideas out into the world. Everything they had worked on was a work project or a byproduct of their job.

> I’ll say it again - a shockingly small number of people have built their own thing on the internet.

The percentage of people that have some sort of side project is tiny. Since we are talking about web projects, the population in questions is programmers and developers. Even people at large tech companies ([[FAANG]]) rarely have any publicly available side projects.

Having those projects is a massive differentiator. You will stand out when applying to jobs, you will learn a lot while building the projects and you will attract good people.
