Whenever my dad came to visit us in the US, he would take a couple of days to deal with [[Jetlag]]. Even if he fell asleep around 10-11pm our time, he would still wake up in the middle of the night, just cause his internal clock told him to. 

I thought this was stupid and always told him that for it works more simple where my body sleeps around  7-8 hours, and it doesn't matter what time I slept.

This morning (2020-10-12) I woke up at 4am, after falling asleep at 11pm. I would say that this changes with age, but I have a strong feeling now that my dad's case, and now my own are almost the normal, it makes sense.

This almost likely has something to do with [[Circadian Rhythm]] and the body producing certain chemicals at specific times based on on its usual schedule
