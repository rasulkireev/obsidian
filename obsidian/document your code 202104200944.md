> Writing documentation can be made easier by not duplicating effort or wasting time, and by keeping documentation close at hand—in the code itself.

I initially was not sure if this refers to code comments or to README docs, but am pretty sure now that this is referring more to comments in the style of docstrings.

It is indeed a good practice. I was recently looking through my code in the market toolkit and the description of a long function was nice.
