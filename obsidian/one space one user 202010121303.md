[[Atomic Habits 202010131439]]

When trying to build new, one useful thing to remember is that attaching a habit to a different location can be very helpful. So, separating the work room from exercise room, from rest room is a good idea. If you don't have that many room, using different parts of the room is just as good. For example, sofa for reading, desk for work, toilet for meditation.
