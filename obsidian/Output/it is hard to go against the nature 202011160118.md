Humans have been evolving or thousands of years. Most of those years we have spent in the pre historic ages, where most of our [[DNA]], reflexes were programmed into us.

This is why sometimes, the actions that we take don't make sense, or don't make us happy. Going against these urges is a hard task, just because we have spent so much time (evolutionary) learning those urges.
