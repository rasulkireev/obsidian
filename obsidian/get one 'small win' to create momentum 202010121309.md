> You should get one “small win” to create momentum in each life domain that’s important to you.

When I got up earlier, suddenly the whole day was more likely to be a success. If I wake up earlier I have more motivation to go to gym, then to work on side projects, than to start the work itself. The simple act of waking up earlier is a small win that makes the whole day better.

One needs to make sure the small win is indeed small, otherwise a chance to screw up the whole day increases.
