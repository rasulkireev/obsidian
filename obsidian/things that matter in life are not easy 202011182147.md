It seems pretty obvious and fare to me that the things that matter in life are the hard things, and vice versa.

If something was good and easy, everyone would do it and it wouldn't be so good anymore. Therefore there are not that many such things. Additionally, if a thing is hard and bad, it doesn't make sense to pursue it.

This is to say, if something is hard and is potentially good for you, that normal and you shouldn't be whining about it being hard.
