> Psychologists who interviewed the multitaskers did test them instead of just asking. They gave them different tasks to accomplish and compared their results with another group that was instructed to do only one thing at a time. The outcome is unambiguous: While those who multitasked felt more productive, their productivity actually decreased – a lot (Wang and Tchernev 2012; Rosen 2008; Ophir, Nass, and Wagner 2009).

Multitasking is a myth. At least the claims that multitasking is more productive are false. Research shows that people who multitask indeed to feel like they are productive, but in reality their numbers are much worse than the people who do and think one task at a time.
