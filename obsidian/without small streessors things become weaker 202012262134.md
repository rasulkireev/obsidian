> Just as spending a month in bed (preferably with an unabridged version of War and Peace and access to The Sopranos’ entire eighty-six episodes) leads to muscle atrophy, complex systems are weakened, even killed, when deprived of stressors.

If we don't move we lose out muscles. In other words, withough stressors our muscle atrpophy. The same is everything else in life. Complex systems get vulnerable if they are not regularly tested with small stressors.
