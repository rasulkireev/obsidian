> Any sort of communication telling your customers how well they’re doing is likely to go over well.

Generally telling people how good they are is a good strategy. It's not even a strategy, but rather a good thing to do. It's a win-win, you get on their good side, they feel better about themselves and are likely to continue the good actions or even perform them better. This works both for life and work.
