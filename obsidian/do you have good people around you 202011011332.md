> Who are the 20% of people who produce 80% of your enjoyment and propel you forward, and which 20% cause 80% of your depression, anger, and second-guessing?

To me this is yet another question that one should ask to [[live life with intention 202010160226]]. You should regularly question your life, or rather various parts of your life. Are you pursuing good goals, do you have good people around you etc.

The only way to improve your life is to do regular quality checks/calibrations.
