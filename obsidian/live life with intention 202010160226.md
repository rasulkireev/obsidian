> Environment design is powerful not only because it influences how we engage with the world but also because we rarely do it. Most people live in a world others have created for them. But you can alter the spaces where you live and work to increase your exposure to positive cues and reduce your exposure to negative ones. Environment design allows you to take back control and become the architect of your life. Be the designer of your world and not merely the consumer of it.

Whatever you do in life you need to do it with an intention. Don't just go with the flow, but examine you surroundings, examine the choices you make during the day and why you make them. Stop during the day to think if what you are doing makes sense. **Think about the reasoning for you actions, this will help you decide on your next actions.**
