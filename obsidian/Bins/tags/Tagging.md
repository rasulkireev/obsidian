In my [[System]] / [[Zettelkasten]] "tags" should be descriptive. So a tag would describe a note with one word. For example, something can be a ==\#book==, or a ==\#tag==, ==\#evergreenNote== etc.

Furthermore, tags, can and should be used to describe the status of the note. For example, ==\#done==, ==\#active==, ==\#inbox==.
