- Started watching the [[Everyone Can Build a Twitter Audience]] by [[Daniel Vassallo]]. One of the first things he talks about is building [[Credibility]]. There are many ways to do that, but the main that he is talking about is essentially blog posts that show your knowledge in the field.
- This got me thinking what could I do to show my credibility, and what credibilities, do I even have. Couple of things popped into my head:
	- [[How I Got a Job in the US as an international student]] 
	- [[How I got a job as a Software Engineer without a CS degree]]
- Those topics are on the rise right now and could become popular. 
- The cool thing is that in addition to telling my personal journey I could also share some cool facts about nationality in US unis and Software Engineering statistics. Very similar to capstone from [[Nat Eliason]]'s Roam [[Efforless Output in Roam|course]].

## Daily Plan
- [x] post my new episode on social media (Twitter, HN, Django Forum, Django Reddit)
