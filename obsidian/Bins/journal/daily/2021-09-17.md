- yet again it feels like I've taken too much on. The reason I'm feeling this is because celarly I haven't updated the [[Built with Django]] project, or the [[Built with Django Podcast]]. I haven't done any work on the [[OTB Chess]] project.
- It's not like I have been doing nothing. Far from it. I have recently learnt a lot in the world of [[Cryptocurrency]], [[Ethereum]], etc.
- However, as per usual, I think it would be a good exercise to go through the things that are on my plate right now.
