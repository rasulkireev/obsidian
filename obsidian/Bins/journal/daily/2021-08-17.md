- When I was watching [[Daniil Chen | Danya]]'s wedding videos yesterday, I was generally a little sad, but when there was a video with [[Viktor Lobov]]'s video message, I realized how stupid I am felt really sad! I think this is something I'm going to be regretting for some time now. I was too (don't even know what word to use) shy, lazy, you name it.
- Combine it with the fact that I swore really hard in front of [[Tatiana Dema|Tanya]]'s parents and brother (accidentally) and you can get a very unfortunate and sad day.
- and that is considering the great process I made with the [[OSS2.0]] deployment process. More in the [[#^069674]] section.

- Yesterday had a big progress at @[[Guy Carpenter|GC]]. I was able to finally deploy a [[Django]] application on a [[Kubernetes]] cluster built by [[Marsh & McLennan Companies]] ([[OSS2.0]]). 
	- Just the fact that I finally deployed it is nice, but also the fact that my understanding of how the platform works increased immensly. Now I just want to continue this process of learning and improving. Will see how today goes. Probably have to focus a bit on the [[Market Toolkit]] project.
