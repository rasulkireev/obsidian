- I'm still thinking on the best apporach to task management... As of this moment there are a number of services I use that can help with [[Project Management]]: 
	- [[Obsidian]]
	- [[Todoist]]
	- [[Github]]
- Ok, it's not so bad. Now I just need to think how to use those. If I were to use the [[Don't Repeat Yourself | DRY]] principle, I would only keep one of those systems. 
- The first one to go is probably [[Github]], as this is more focused on [[Repository | repos]] that are [[Open Source]].
