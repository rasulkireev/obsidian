#### What are we doing today?
- Going to [[Happy Day Farm]] with our [[Neighbors]] today. 
- Going to the [[Farm]] to look at sunflower blooming, take some photos, pick some blueberries. I also will buy some farm [[Eggs]], back to the good stuff if you will :)

#### How do I feel?
- After the very long day with our [[Neighbors]] on Saturday, I want to take a break from spending time with them and focus on other things.
- I really enjoyed playing [[Chess]] in the [[Military Park]] yesterday. I played to [[Blitz]] games with a person who looked very much like an [[NYC]] [[Hustler]]. I flagged the opponent in the first game, actually played well, but then kind of [[Relaxed]] and had a lost position, but officially, I won. The second game I lost. I had a little worse position, but I also blundered my rook. I [[Enjoyed]] the fact that even though there are no people in the park mostly, once we started playing, people gathered to look. That was [[Fun]], I'll try to do that more often.
- I do think about the fact that I have journal scattered everywhere... [[Physical Journal]], [[Joplin]], [[Obsidian]], which makes me [[Worried]] in the sense that it should be more or less centralized. But in the end it doesn't really matter. What matters is that I make those entries.
