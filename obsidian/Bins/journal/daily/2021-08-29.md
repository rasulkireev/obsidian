- Recently have been working on [[Built with Django]] more consistently. Don't think I'm making a lot of progress in terms of the ability to earn money, but certainly am making the product a little better each day.
- Need to spend some time to think whether the path I'm taking with  [[Built with Django]] is the right one. Should I focus more on potential revenue? Or [[Audience Building]]. I certainly should be sending emails with updates to subscribers. and do this regularly. 

- I have let my [[Personal Website]] hang in the air for a little too long now (without any updates), same goes for my [[Newsletters]]. I just can't get myself to write it as much as before. Not sure what is wrong. Maybe, I feel like I shouldn't do it, unless I do it right... which is stupid, obviously.
- Regarding the newsletter, I should send just something, to make this consistent again, and it doesn't matter if it is short. In fact, many people prefer short.
- Actually that makes me think that another reason that I procrastinate doing the newsletter is that the time it takes to "repurpose" the content to other stream, like [[Twitter]] takes too much time, and perhaps to small of the yield.

- It's interesting that I decided to make this entry, while I was watching the latest [[Matt D'Avella]] video. He is always so inspiring. No idea how he does it.
