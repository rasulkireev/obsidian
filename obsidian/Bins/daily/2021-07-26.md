How I feel?
- I feel [[Good]]. Went to bed around 23:30 yesterday, which is better than latest average, but still not good enough in terms of ideal state. Ideally would like to go to bed around 22:00-22:30, including 20-30 minutes of reading. I want to do that to wake up earlier to work on projects like [[Built with Django]].
- It seems that I can't do "streaming" or other project related stuff during work, or while [[Tatiana Dema | Tanya]] is not sleeping.
- Today I slept good, only woke up once during the night, and seems that I have pulled my neck a little bit. Otherwise waking up was fine. Well, considering that my plan was to wake up at 7:30, and I ended up waking up at 9:30, I can see why I feel alright :D
- That's probably one of the reason most people like remote work: You can go to sleep later and can sleep more. I'm not like that, I don't want to use Remote work for sleeping purposes only. For me, the ideal state would be to use that saved time on [[Learning]] or [[Side Hustle]].
