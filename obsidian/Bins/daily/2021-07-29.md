- Preparation to the [[3rd Anniversary]] going [[Fine]].
- I bought an ultra expensive duvet from [[MUJI]] (~$350). I know [[Tatiana Dema | Tanya]] loves it, so hopefully should be an interesting surprise.
- I think the plan for other gifts is clear...
	- Get an expensive accessory ([[Handbag]], probably, maybe [[Maison Margiela]] x [[Reebok]] sneakers) ~$700
	- Small accessory from [[Mure + Grand]], if there is something (~$50)
	- [[Gummy Bears]] from [[Sugarfina]] (~$20)
	- and some [[Flowers]] (~$20)
	- This would roughly total to 1100-1200 USD... Crazy
	- Well, next time, if I [[Preparation | prepare]] in advance, this can probably be reduced...
