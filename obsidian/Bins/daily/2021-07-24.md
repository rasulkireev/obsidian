This  is going to be an example of [[Morning Pages]] that [[Nat Eliason]] does in the [[Effortless Output in Roam - Part 8 - Appendix 2 - Bonus Use Cases | Effortless Output in Roam course]]

## Morning Page (here Evening Pages 😆) - 22:55

![[Morning Pages Promts#^57ae91]] blah blah blah....
![[Morning Pages Promts#^f3dbc9]] blah blah blah....

Formatting is a little off for the things above.

I actually like the way I do it.

## Topic (General)
### Time (22:59)

I feel like this allows for potential future parsing. Although, honestly speaking probably won't happen :).


## [[Love]]
### 23:18

- Right now, I feel like I love my wife more than anything in the world, and I noticed that I feel that more and more.
- This is a [[Great Feeling]]! I am very [[Happy]] that I feel it more often. The only thing that is [[Weird]] to me, is that when I feel that immense love at the same time a weird [[Fear]] strikes me. I'm [[Scared]] that I might lose that some day.
	- This might be related to [[Fear Setting]] / [[Negative Visualization]], that is practiced by [[Stoicism | Stoics]].
	- I can't say that I particularly enjoy these thoughts, but they certainly help me realize how [[Lucky]] and [[Happy]] I am.
