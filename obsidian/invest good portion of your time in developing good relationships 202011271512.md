> Invest in relationships. Your community matters more than you think.

Relationships matter a lot in life. It's people who make all the decisions, be it hiring or sharing something, and knowing more people opens you up to many such opportunities. 

This means to reach out to people personally, via email or DMs, participating in various communities that interest you. Invest a good portion of your time in developing these relationships.
