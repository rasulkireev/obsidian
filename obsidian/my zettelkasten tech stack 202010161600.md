- For **fleeting notes** and **literature notes** I use [[Joplin]].
- For the [[Zettelkasten]] **permanent notes** I use [[Obsidian]]

## Literature Notes
- I make sticky notes in the book to reference them after I finish or at the end of the day.
	- If the note is particularly insightful I will write it in my [[Joplin Book Notes Notebook]]. This notebook will be reviewed this day (or even minute). 
	- Note: To look at the latest entries use Joplin's handy search `updated` filter.
- When I read [[Kindle]] I make highlights. Highlights are treated the same way as bookmarks:
	- write down immediately
	- or review later
- Once a month I upload "My Clippings" to [[Readwise]] and [[Clippings.io]]
	- Clippings has a record of all my highlights, unedited.
		- This helps me keep a record of all the notes I have taken before. Those, I don't look often. Just for the piece of mind.
	- Readwise on the other hand offers me to review 5-6 highlights each morning. I approve, remove or edit them. So, with time, my Readwise "database" will only have good notes that liked.
		- Any time that a Readwise highlight sparks a thought I enter it in my Zettelkasten. I usually share it on Twitter also.
