> But even though flashcards are much more effective than cramming or reviewing information within the context of a textbook, they also have a downside: The information on flashcards is neither elaborated on nor embedded in some form of context. Each flashcard stays isolated instead of being connected with the network of theoretical frames, our experiences or our latticework of mental models. This not only makes it much more difficult to learn, but also difficult to understand the implications and the meaning of information (cf. Birnbaum et al., 2013).

There is no perfect system out there. Everything has upsides and downsides. Flashcards and SRS is an incredibly powerful learning method. One downside of SRS is the lack of contest in a flashcard.
