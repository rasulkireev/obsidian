> Since men love freedom, and the freedom of individuals in society requires some regulation of conduct, the first condition of freedom is its limitation; make it absolute and it dies in chaos. So the prime task of government is to establish order; organized central force is the sole alternative to incalculable and disruptive force in private hands.

Absolute freedom dies in chaos, it is not possible. Beauty comes from strict rules. The example I like to is [[Chess]]. The reason for existence of beautiful games that we can appreciate is that because there are clear rules. Only by having rules can we appreciate the creativeness.

On the other hand, too much order is a bad thing also. This leads to a case like North Korea, which of this writing is a bad case.

One could say that government is necessary evil or rather something like a devils advocate.
