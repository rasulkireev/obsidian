[[Atomic Habits 202010131439]]

> Whenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the group to guide our behavior. We are constantly scanning our environment and wondering, “What is everyone else doing?” We check reviews on Amazon or Yelp or TripAdvisor because we want to imitate the “best” buying, eating, and travel habits.

We, humans, are social animals. We are constantly looking at our surroundings / communities (people) to find "normal" behavior. We then take that behavior and mimic it to fit better. With the inventions and popularization of social networks, this became even more apparent. 

We now often make big life decisions based on what other people have done. Buying a house, a car, a phone and other things/services.
