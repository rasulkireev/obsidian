Some people argue that it is better to be a connector, rather than a collector, when it comes to note taking. I agrees with this sentiment, but will argue for being a collector too.

RLL ([[Really Long List]]) is a great marketing strategy. People love a collection / compilation of best resources. Basically, this is very similar to curation. [[Curation is going to very valuable as we see more content online 202101210240]]. And after collecting for, say, a year you will have an abundance of things to share.

This is one of the advantages of building a second brain, with [[Joplin]] or [[Evernote]], [[Webclipping]] the cool resources you encounter.
