> Solo, we were both a "10." Together, we're a "100." Teaming up hasn't given us 2x; it's given us 10x.
> With a good partner, you get their whole brain, skills, passion, energy, network. It's hard to replicate that kind of commitment with employees or investors.

When you can make partners with someone your level of skill, knowledge and enthusiasm, it makes sense to do it, because together you can make 10x more than each one could do alone. It's awesome if people have slightly different expertise, complementing each other.
