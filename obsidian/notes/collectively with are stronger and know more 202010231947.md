[[Traction 202010160218]]

> We set out to help startups get traction no matter what business they were in: from Internet companies to local small businesses and everything in between. We drew on our personal experiences, interviewed more than forty founders, studied many more companies, and pulled out the repeatable framework they used to succeed.

Authors tell us that they talked to a lot of people and therefore know more. Maybe, that's not what they are saying, but it is still true. 

Collectively, the humanity super smart. Rather 2 people are smarter than one, 3 smarter than 2, and so one. Each one person brings his experience and knowledge to the table. **The lesson here is to ask other people for help, ask good questions. Reach out to people that are smarter than you and don't worry about looking silly.**
