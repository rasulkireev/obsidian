Chapter 21 STAY WITH HER INTENSITY—TO A POINT

> One of the deepest feminine pleasures is when a man stands full, present, and unreactive in the midst of his woman’s emotional storms. When he stays present with her, and loves her through the layers of wildness and closure, then she feels his trustability, and she can relax. **The way you relate to your woman’s chaos reflects the way you react to the chaos of the world.**

In terms of family the feminine does thrive in a stable and trustable environment, this makes sense. What's more important is to look at this through a more broad lense. By having your partner, you get to train your reaction to the unstable to the unpredictable and this in  away prepares you for the surprises that the real world will throw at you.
