From Chapter 16 - WOMEN ARE NOT LIARS

> You might ask her, “Do you want to go to the movies?” She might reply, “Not really.” Then you hug her and spin her around and say, “Let’s go to the movies!” And she says, “Okay!”

Try to be more decisive in a relationship. Instead of being passive ("What do you want to do?"), be more active ("We are going to movies.").
