> Lists bring order to the chaotic universe. I love making lists. Whenever I need to figure out my life, I make a list. A list gets all your ideas out of your head and clears the mental space so you’re actually able to do something about them. When I’m overwhelmed, I fall back on the old-fashioned to-do list. I make a big list of everything that needs to get done, I pick the most pressing thing to do, and I do it. Then I cross it off the list and pick another thing to do. Repeat.

> A     DAILY     LIST     HELPS     BUILD     (AND     MAINTAIN)     MOMENTUM AND MOTIVATION.Writing  a  list  of  just  a  few  items  —  the  things  that  are  most  important  for  today  —  and  crossing  all  of  them  off  is  far  more  motivational than crossing those same few items off a list with dozens of items on it.

Generally, [[writing things down reduces stress and makes prioritization easier 202011221822]]. This can be any form of writing. Sometimes, when we can't get our thoughts straight, putting them down on paper helps to structure those thoughts, or just offload them from your brain.

An exceptional form of writing for reducing stress and creating structure is making lists. Lists by nature are very structured, and they force you to think more consicely. So, when you feel the need to add more structure or offload your brain making a list can be very helpful. This can be any sort of list, shopping list, current projects lists, current tasks list, etc.
