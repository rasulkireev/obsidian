> You don’t have to be an expert to teach. Even if you are learning a new skill or topic, you can still teach it. Chances are someone will always know less about it than you do.

If you tell yourself that you are not good enough to teach people, you need to understand that this is horseshit. Anyone can teach anyone no matter what the topic is. It is just fear within you that tells you that you can't teach others, you won't be accepted, you will be laughed at.
