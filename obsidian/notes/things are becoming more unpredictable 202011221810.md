> ...it is hard to see how things work by looking at single parts. Man-made complex systems tend to develop cascades and runaway chains of reactions that decrease, even eliminate, predictability and cause outsized events. So the modern world may be increasing in technological knowledge, but, paradoxically, it is making things a lot more unpredictable.

It is funny how unpredictable the world is becoming, given the progress in technology. Everyday humans come up with better ML algorithms, but they can't catch up with the pace of complexity. Our inventions and principles are becoming more and more complex. Each new inventions is an addition the the network of existing ideas. This entanglement is what make it so hard to predict. It is almost impossible to look at things in isolation, they are always a part of a bigger system.
