Chapter 12 - Develop Ideas

> Studies on creativity with engineers show that the ability to find not only creative, but functional and working solutions for technical problems is equal to the ability to make abstractions. The better an engineer is at abstracting from a specific problem, the better and more pragmatic his solutions will be – even for the very problem he abstracted from ([[Opening up the Solution Space - The Role of Analogical Thinking for Breakthrough Product Innovation | Gassmann and Zeschky, 2008, 103]]).

Having the ability to abstract from the current problem increases the chances of a faster solving of such problem. There is a correlation between people who are able to abstract well, and solve technical problems creatively and functionally.
