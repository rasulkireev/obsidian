> If we can focus on making clear what parts of our day are within our control and what parts are not, we will not only be happier, we will have a distinct advantage over other people who fail to realize they are fighting an unwinnable battle.

Focus on the things that are under your control, while relaxing about the tings that are not. This will make you feel in control and as a consequence more happy.

A daily ritual can help you keep yourself in check. This could be a question during your [[Journaling]] practice. "Am I worrying about things that are not under my control?"
