Chapter 20 - ON’T SUGGEST THAT A WOMAN FIX HER OWN EMOTIONAL PROBLEM

> One of the deepest feminine desires in intimacy (though not in business or simple friendship) is to be able to relax and surrender, knowing that her man is taking care of everything.

The desire to relax and trust another person can be attributed to any human being, not feminine only. However, it does make sense that in the feminine this desire is stronger, whereas in the masculine this arises only some times, which leads to this "set up" most of the times.
