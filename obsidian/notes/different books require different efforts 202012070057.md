> Sometimes it is necessary to slowly work our way through a difficult text and sometimes it is enough to reduce a whole book to a single sentence.

There are books that are hard to understand; those books require your full attention and a good amount of time. At the same time there are books that can be summed up in a single sentence. There are good books in both categories. 

I don't think there are many examples of the latter part, but there certainly are some. 

The important thing here is to try figuring out what book you are about to open, since you don't want to waste much of your time on a book that should be quick to grasp, or on the other hand, dismiss a book that should be consumed slowly. This is discussed in detail in [[How to Read a Book 202010131541]].
