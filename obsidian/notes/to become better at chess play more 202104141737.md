[[How to Quickly Improve Your Chess Game 202102191201]]

> Recommendation: Aim for about 10 quick games on most days if you want to improve as quickly as possible. Or just play a game or two more than you are playing now to steadily improve at a more moderate rate. The key is to play, play, play.

The key to improving at chess is to play more games. Here the author suggests multiple "quick games", but I would argue and say that it would probably be better to play fewer but longer games, which would allow you to think about your moves and calculate your position. I found that 15|10 time control is a good balance between too quick and too slow games. 

10 games a day is a lot. I can do 3 a day max. This should still be sufficient for learning opportunities, especially at the beginning.
