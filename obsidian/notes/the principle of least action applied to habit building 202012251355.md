> This is a foundational principle in physics, where it is known as the Principle of Least Action. It states that the path followed between any two points will always be the path requiring the least energy. This simple principle underpins the laws of the universe. From this one idea, you can describe the laws of motion and relativity.

The Principle of Least Action states that the particles will follow the path between two points in a manner that requires the least action. Most often it is the shortest route. We can you this principle in designing out habits. We need to make it as easy as possible to complete the habit.
