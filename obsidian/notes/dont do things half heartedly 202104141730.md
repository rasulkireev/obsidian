Chapter 7 - YOUR PURPOSE MUST COME BEFORE YOUR RELATIONSHIP

> Time you spend with your woman should be time you really want to be with her more than anything else. If you’d rather be doing something else, she’ll feel it. Both of you will be dissatisfied.

Never do things half heartedly, especially when it comes to your significant other. If at any point you don't feel 100% about spending time together and are thinking about something else, she will feel it, and it will be a waste of time for everyone.

This in principle is very similar to the note about [[in fatherhood quality is more important than quantity 202103221306 | fatherhood]]. Quality is more important than quantity.
