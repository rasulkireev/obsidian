> The lesson to draw is to be generally sceptical about planning, especially if it is merely focused on the outcome, not on the actual work and the steps required to achieve a goal. While it doesn’t help to imagine oneself the great author of a successful and timely finished paper, it does make a difference if we have a realistic idea about what needs to be done to get there in our minds.

There is no use of planning when you need to finish the paper by. The estimate is vague and untrustworthy. It makes much more sense to plan and schedule the work that will produce the desired outcome.  

When i see a clear path to the end goal, I am indeed more motivated.
