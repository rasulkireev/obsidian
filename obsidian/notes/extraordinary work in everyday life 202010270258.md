> You do not need to have an extraordinary life to make extraordinary work. Everything you need to make extraordinary art can be found in your everyday life.

You wake up everyday with a whole day ahead of you. Most of the time, you choose what you can do. Each one of us can do incredible things during that day. The most boring examples that come to mind are to:
- write about your hobbies
- record podcast interviews
- try to reach out to people you admire

You just need to decide what to do and start doing it.
