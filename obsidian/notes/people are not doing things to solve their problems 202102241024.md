[[About Reading 100 Books]]

> You get bothered because most of the people you talk with are not doing anything to solve these problems. They simply add more burden to their lives and avoid taking responsibility by blaming others or the system for their struggles.

When you read more books it does indeed seem that you can see the reason for peoples' problems. This makes you suggest how to solve those problems to those people. It is painful to see those people make there problems worse, by reacting incorrectly (blaming others, ignoring the problem). The paradox is that if you try help it only makes things worse. I have yet to discover how to help such people.
