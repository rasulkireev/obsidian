Chapter XII - Growth and Decay

> No student takes seriously the seventeenth-century notion that states arose out of a "social contract" among individuals or between the people and a ruler. Probably most states (i.e., societies politically organized) took form through the conquest of one group by another, and the establishment of a continuing force over the conquered by the conqueror; his decrees were their first laws; and these, added to the customs of the people, created a new social order.

No way in hell that states arose from calm agreements. It is very like (99.99%) that first states were formed after aggressive conquering by one group and establishing some sort of order over the conquered (i.e. Government, from the word govern).
