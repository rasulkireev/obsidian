> The people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it the least. It’s easier to practice self-restraint when you don’t have to use it very often. So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment.

The key to great self-discipline is not to test it, but by rather making it easy for yourself. Instead of buying a muffin and resisting eating it, just don't buy and you won't have to test your discipline
