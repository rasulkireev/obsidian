> Our evolutionary ancestors who feared lions were less likely to be eaten by one than those who were indifferent to them. Likewise, our tendency to experience anxiety and insatiability is a consequence of our evolutionary past. Our evolutionary ancestors who felt anxious about whether they had enough food were less likely to starve than those who didn’t worry about where their next meal was coming from. Similarly, our evolutionary ancestors who were never satisfied with what they had, who always wanted more food or better shelter, were more likely to survive and reproduce than those who were easily satisfied.

The Fear is a relic of the past. For out ancestors fear was the deciding factor between life and death. This does not apply in our world. 

In the past only the people who felt fear at the right time were the ones to survive. Fearing a sound in the dark, and moving away from that. The fear of not finding food and therefore moving around more. Those who did not have those fears, simply died. This made sense back then, but not anymore. 

The world we live in now does not have the same environment, the same dangers. It is wise to think about our fears and if it makes sense to follow along. Understandably [[it is hard to go against the nature 202011160118]]
