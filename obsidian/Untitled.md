[[How to Read a Book 202010131541]]

> You cannot follow rules you do not know. Nor can you acquire an artistic habit—any craft or skill—without following rules.

Rules allow us to be free to be creative. For example, a simple game of chess has strict rules. These rules allow for beautiful games to happen, each with a twist. On the other hand if there were no rules, we would see useless mumbo jumbo that makes no sense. 

Another example comes from business. In countries with laws governing how the business should be done (USA, for example), we see beautiful companies emerge. On the other had when the laws are a little more vague, shit happens. Take Russia for example, with the lack of law regulating the governement we see corruption rise to the top.
