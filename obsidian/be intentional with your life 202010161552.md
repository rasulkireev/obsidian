> So before you start your business, or before you return to it tomorrow, ask yourself the following questions:  
> - What do I wish my life to look like? 
> - How do I wish my life to be on a day-to-day basis? 
> - What would I like to be able to say I truly know in my life, about my life? 
> - How would I like to be with other people in my life—my family, my friends, my business associates, my customers, my employees, my community? 
> - How would I like people to think about me? 
> - What would I like to be doing two years from now? Ten years from now? Twenty years from now? When my life comes to a close? 
> - What specifically would I like to learn during my life—spiritually, physically, financially, technically, intellectually? About relationships? 
> - How much money will I need to do the things I wish to do? By when will I need it?

The author gives a good list of questions to ask yourself before starting a business. I think this is a great list of question to ask yourself any day. People need to live [[live life with intention 202010160226]]. People need to think about reasons behind their actions and choices. So, asking yourself these kind of questions on a regular basis will help you stay on a good path towards your actual goals.
