[[The 48 Laws of Power 202012262111]]

> Men are more ready to repay an injury than a benefit, because gratitude is a burden and revenge a pleasure. [[Tacitus]]

It supplements the 2nd Law: Never Put Too Much Trust In Friends, Learn How To Use Enemies. I think the point is that someone is much more likely to repay an injury they caused you, rather than a benefit that you have provided. Enemies are safer than friends.
