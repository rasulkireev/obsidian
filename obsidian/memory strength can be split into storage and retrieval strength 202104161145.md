Chapter 11 - Take Smart Notes

> Robert and Elizabeth Ligon Bjork from the University of California suggest distinguishing between two different measurements when it comes to memory: Storage strength and retrieval strength (Bjork 2011).

One way to look and compare memory strength is by splitting it into Storage strength (how well you can store the data) and retrieval strength (how well you use/retrieve the saved information). Makes sense, but seems problematic to test... Read the actual paper for more info.

Btw, I think my retrieval is pretty good, but storage can be improved. 

Also, both attributes can probably be trained or rather activated by an [[Space Repetition System]] like [[Anki]].
