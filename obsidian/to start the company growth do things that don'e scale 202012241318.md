[[Traction 202010160218]]

> Not all traction channels are infinitely scalable. In fact, using tactics that don’t scale is one of the best ways to get your first customers. [[Paul Graham]] put it like this: The need to do something unscalably laborious to get started is so nearly universal that it might be a good idea to stop thinking of startup ideas as scalars. Instead we should try thinking of them as pairs of what you’re going to build, plus the unscalable thing(s) you’re going to do initially to get the company going.

Very often to get the growth of a fresh startup going you need to start with things that don't scale. Don't yet invest time into automated newsletters, email prospects and clients individually. Yes, you won't be able to reach a million people, but that's not what you need. You need to find traction, feedback and good customers.
