Chapter IX. The Ethical Solution

> There are only three things worth while in this world—justice, beauty and truth; and perhaps none of them can be defined.

From [[Plato]]'s "[[The Republic 202104141744]]"

Justice is worthwhile, truth is also very important. But what do authors mean by beauty and why is it worth while? Do they mean the human beauty (Pretty Lady) or rather more conceptual beauty like a beautiful chess game?
