The idea of the project is to generate images with three [[Cistercian Numerals]] corresponding to Year, Month and Day, respectively.

Then after images are generated upload them to a decentralized storage and mint them to a custom [[Smart Contract]]. Upon minting they should be automatically added to the Opensea collection.

Tasks to do:
- [ ] Move to "Professional" [[Pinata 202109081330]] plan to set up a Gateway, to make sure Opensea can access the metadata without hitting an API limit
- [ ] test on Polygon testnet

Prod Checklist
- [ ] make sure the Pinata storage is empty
- [ ]
