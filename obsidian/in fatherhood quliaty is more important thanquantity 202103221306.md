Chapter 13 - DON’T USE YOUR FAMILY AS AN EXCUSE

> A short period of time with a father who is absolutely present, full in love, undivided inside, and sure of his mission in life, will affect your children much more positively than if they spend lots of time with a father who is ambiguous in his intent and has lost touch with his deepest purpose, no matter how much he loves his children.

A little of quality time is much better than a lot of unintended time. In parenting, quality > quantity, at least from the father's point of view.
