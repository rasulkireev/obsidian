[[Introduction to the Zettelkasten Method]]

> As you connect, you will learn, understand, and thus expand yourself in two ways: 
> - (a) Your knowledge will increase and 
> - (b) you will be a better observer. 
> 
> By being a better observer, you will be able to draw more insights from observation. More universal patterns arise and become more apparent to you. A fundamental aspect of working like this is that it allows you to access the general patterns of reality.

By regularly connecting note you will 
- get better recall of your notes
- will become a better observer
- and will become much better at seeing patterns (this skill can also be improved with the help of [[Chess]])

Lesson here is to read with an intention of making connections. This has many hidden benefits, like better learning and more insightful observations.
