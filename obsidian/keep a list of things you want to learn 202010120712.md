#learning

- Making a note of the things you'd like to learn is a great way to avoid stale situations in life. This probably won't be the first thing you look at when you are bored, but it is certainly handy to have this list ready to use.
- I can do this here in Obsidian by writing hashtag tolearn or in Joplin by adding a tolearn tag. Either is fine, but really need to choose, since it is better to keep centralized. Since my Joplin database is a little more "complete" I'll keep it there.
- idea came from [[Shu Omi]] video on [Becoming A Learning Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsKf6sX-3Xg).

Keep a list of things to learn. I think my set up is good, but make sure you do you and be intentional about it.
