## Metadata

## Highlights
- CURRENCY IN ITALY IN 1500 (Location 110)
### INTRODUCTION I Can Also Paint
- the ability to make connections across disciplines—arts and sciences, humanities and technology—is a key to innovation, imagination, and genius. (Location 160)
    - Note: Zettelkasten is ideal for this
- His genius was of the type we can understand, even take lessons from. It was based on skills we can aspire to improve in ourselves, such as curiosity and intense observation. He had an imagination so excitable that it flirted with the edges of fantasy, which is also something we can try to preserve in ourselves and indulge in our children. (Location 176)
- Vision without execution is hallucination. (Location 184)
    - Note: Perfectionists are hallucinating
- Fortunately, Leonardo could not afford to waste paper, so he crammed every inch of his pages with miscellaneous drawings and looking-glass jottings that seem random but provide intimations of his mental leaps. Scribbled alongside each other, with rhyme if not reason, are math calculations, sketches of his devilish young boyfriend, birds, flying machines, theater props, eddies of water, blood valves, grotesque heads, angels, siphons, plant stems, sawed-apart skulls, tips for painters, notes on the eye and optics, weapons of war, fables, riddles, and studies for paintings. The cross-disciplinary brilliance whirls across every page, providing a delightful display of a mind dancing with nature. (Location 190)
    - Note: - Mixing things up in notebooks is fine
- The fifteenth century of Leonardo and Columbus and Gutenberg was a time of invention, exploration, and the spread of knowledge by new technologies. In short, it was a time like our own. That is why we have much to learn from Leonardo. His ability to combine art, science, technology, the humanities, and imagination remains an enduring recipe for creativity. So, too, was his ease at being a bit of a misfit: illegitimate, gay, vegetarian, left-handed, easily distracted, and at times heretical. Florence flourished in the fifteenth century because it was comfortable with such people. (Location 271)
    - Note: Leonardo was an oitlier in many senses. Florence flourished cause it accepted such people. Accepting werd ois good.
### CHAPTER 1 Childhood Vinci, 1452–1464
#### DA VINCI
- Leonardo left us no comment on the circumstances of his birth, but there is one tantalizing allusion in his notebooks to the favors that nature bestows upon a love child. “The man who has intercourse aggressively and uneasily will produce children who are irritable and untrustworthy,” he wrote, “but if the intercourse is done with great love and desire on both sides, the child will be of great intellect, witty, lively, and lovable.”8 One assumes, or at least hopes, that he considered himself in the latter category. (Location 334)
#### “A GOLDEN AGE FOR BASTARDS”
#### DISCIPLE OF EXPERIENCE
- But he also took pride that his lack of formal schooling led him to be a disciple of experience and experiment. “Leonardo da Vinci, disscepolo della sperientia,”16 he once signed himself. (Location 383)
#### CHILDHOOD MEMORIES
### CHAPTER 2 Apprentice
#### THE MOVE
- hard to know what he felt about the move. But the fables he recorded sometimes give a glimpse of his sentiments. One described the sad odyssey of a stone perched on a hill surrounded by colorful flowers and a grove of trees—in other words, a place like Vinci. Looking at the crowd of stones along the road below, it decided it wanted to join them. “What am I doing here among these plants?” the stone asked. “I want to live in the company of my fellow stones.” So it rolled down to the others. “After a while,” Leonardo recounted, “it found itself in continual distress from the wheels of the carts, the iron hoofs of horses, and the feet of the passers-by. One rolled it over, another trod upon it. Sometimes the stone raised itself up a little as it lay covered with mud or the dung of some animal, but it was in vain that it looked up at the spot whence it had come as a place of solitude and tranquil peace.” Leonardo drew a moral: “This is what happens to those who leave a life of solitary contemplation and choose to come to dwell in cities among people full of infinite evil.” (Location 476)
    - Note: Living peacefully far from the people clusters is better, more calm.
- Like many artists, he was stimulated by being with people of diverse interests and (willing to contradict himself in his notebooks) declared, “Drawing in company is much better than alone.”4 The impulses of his grandfather and uncle, who both practiced the quiet country life, were imprinted in Leonardo’s imagination but not practiced in his life. (Location 489)
    - Note: Leomardo was flourishing / successfujl under conditions that were the opposite of whatg he thought best fr him. What he though was impriknfed in his had by the xample he saw. But what can be good for some mayh nokt be best for you. It is very important to refect and adjust your lofe based on your own experience nokt someone elses
#### FLORENCE
- The city’s cathedral was the most beautiful in Italy. In the 1430s it had been crowned with the world’s largest dome, built by the architect Filippo Brunelleschi, which was a triumph of both art and engineering, and linking those two disciplines was a key to Florence’s creativity. (Location 520)
    - Note: By combining skills you get something beautiful.
- After Cosimo de’ Medici took over the family bank in the 1430s, it became the largest in Europe. By managing the fortunes of the continent’s wealthy families, the Medici made themselves the wealthiest of them all. (Location 543)
    - Note: The closer you are to big money the more money youll have.
- They were innovators in bookkeeping, including the use of debit-and-credit accounting that became one of the great spurs to progress during the Renaissance. (Location 544)
    - Note: Medici.
- Florence’s festive culture was spiced by the ability to inspire those with creative minds to combine ideas from disparate disciplines. (Location 560)
