- Full Title: I Almost Got Fired for Choosing React in Our Enterprise App
- URL: https://medium.com/better-programming/i-almost-got-fired-for-choosing-react-in-our-enterprise-app-846ea840841c

## Highlights
- I just realized that React is not Java or .NET developer-friendly. Angular would have been a better choice in this case because of similar design patterns.
- I love React. I use it for all my personal projects and would love to recommend it for new work initiatives. However, after the unpleasant experience I had, I will not encourage using it for enterprise applications. Not again.
