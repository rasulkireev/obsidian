## Highlights
- These beneficial dietary items include: Leafy greens and orange-red fruits and vegetables such as apricots, mangoes, red peppers and spinach, which all boost brain function as a result of their antioxidants and beta carotene properties. Certain organic breakfast cereals – especially those fortified with folic acid – have many mental benefits. Fresh seafood has a beneficial impact on the brain as a result of the biochemical roles played by the omega-3 fats and zinc content. Nuts and seeds have essential fatty acids and phospho-lipids that aid brain nerve cells. Protein-rich foods contain large amounts of the brain chemical dopamine, which increases mental alertness. Ginkgo Biloba is a herb that improves blood flow to the brain and has been proven to be a valid way to increase memory and concentration powers. Phosphatidylserine (PS) is a chemical compound that has been shown to assist with learning, focus and memory. Vinpocetine is a plant extract that’s a cerebral vasodilator – meaning it widens blood vessels in the brain and allows more blood to enter the head for oxygenation to occur. The result is greater mental alertness. Recent studies indicate Vinpocetine may also be one of the most powerful memory enhancers on the planet.   General rules for eating for brain optimization include: Rather than eating one or two large meals, consume regular small meals throughout the day as this has positive psychological effects. Eat enough carbohydrates as the brain needs glucose to function. Never skip breakfast, otherwise blood sugar levels will drop by late morning and this will negatively affect memory.   There’s also some good news for alcohol lovers. Red wine, due to the grape content, has a protective agent called resveratrol, which scientific research has shown to stimulate brain cells. Beer can also be a brain-booster because of its high quantities of boron and B vitamins – both of which affect mental function. However, the golden rule of everything in moderation definitely applies to the subject of alcohol and intelligence as overdrinking kills brain cells – never a good thing if you’re already low on brain cells or are looking to increase your intelligence!
