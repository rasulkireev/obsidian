- Full Title: No-Nonsense Buddhism for Beginners

## Highlights
### HOW TO USE THIS BOOK
- It became clear that trying to eliminate suffering was actually causing me more suffering. (Location 50)
- Skillful means is a concept in Mahayana Buddhism that emphasizes that a Buddhist practitioner may use his or her own methods or techniques on the path to enlightenment depending on his or her own particular set of circumstances. (Location 80)
    - Note: Each of us is a unique snowflake.
### PART 1 THE BUDDHA
#### Who was the Buddha? Was he a real person, or is he a myth?
- The Buddha taught a method of living intended to be practiced, rather than a set of ideas he asked his followers to believe. (Location 99)
    - Note: Actions are worth more than words.
#### What language did the Buddha speak? I often hear foreign-sounding words used to describe things in Buddhism—is that the Buddha’s original language?
#### What do we know about the historical Buddha? What led him to his moment of enlightenment?
- After seven days, he suddenly understood that he was the source of his own discomfort and suffering, as well as the source of the joy and contentment he so desperately sought. Upon realizing that the wisdom he sought was to be found within himself rather than outside himself, he attained enlightenment. (Location 124)
#### Reality vs. Our Perception of Reality
- In our day-to-day lives, we’re continually making meaning and creating stories about everything that happens. A thought arises, we create a story about it, the story evokes an emotion, we create another story about that, and on and on until, before we know it, we’re hardly paying attention to our lived reality at all, trapped in a habitual reactivity to our own thoughts. (Location 140)
    - Note: That what meditation is trying to deal with.
- there is great freedom in releasing ourselves from the stories that cloud our perceptions and starting to feel okay with not always understanding the situation we’re in. This is why Buddhism is often referred to as the Path of Liberation. Liberation is the moment you don’t react to being cut off in traffic—because you don’t know what actually happened, so there’s nothing to react to. Liberation is experiencing reality as it is. (Location 144)
#### What does the word Buddha mean?
- Buddhism teaches that there’s reality as it is, and then there’s reality as we humans perceive or understand it. (Location 151)
- Our perception of reality is influenced by how our minds are conditioned; in other words, our ideas, cultural beliefs, concepts, and opinions all directly affect how we see reality. (Location 152)
- A Buddha is someone who is completely liberated from the mistaken perceptions of reality to which we are all so susceptible, thus experiencing nirvana (a Sanskrit word meaning “blown out” or “extinguished”), which is the state of awakened understanding of existence that is the ultimate goal of Buddhist practice. (Location 153)
#### What did the Buddha do after he became enlightened?
#### Did the Buddha have a family?
#### I’ve seen statues and paintings of a fat, happy Buddha. Is that what the Buddha looked like?
- Because Buddha is a title meaning “awakened one,” there have been many Buddhas throughout history. One such person was a Chinese Buddhist monk called Budai, also known as the Laughing Buddha or the Fat Buddha. When you see a statue of a fat, bald man with a smile, you’re seeing Budai, not Siddhartha Gautama, on whose teachings Buddhism was founded. (Location 167)
#### Do Buddhists consider the Buddha to be a god? Do Buddhists worship the Buddha?
- Should you find a wise critic to point out your faults, follow him as you would a guide to hidden treasure. THE BUDDHA, THE DHAMMAPADA (Location 181)

#### So if his main role was being a teacher, what exactly did the Buddha teach?
- This means that enlightenment can’t be explained; it has to be experienced. So instead of teaching a set of beliefs, the Buddha taught a set of practices, a method to help people realize enlightenment for themselves. (Location 188)
- The aim of Buddhism is to help us understand the nature of reality and suffering and let go of the causes of suffering. (Location 193)
- The Buddha’s teachings help us alter that perspective and learn that the unnecessary suffering we experience has more to do with how we see things than with what we see. It’s an internal change, not an external one, that will bring about the joy and contentment we seek. (Location 198)
#### EVERYDAY BUDDHISM Chris Wasn’t There
#### When did the Buddha die? Did another spiritual leader take his place?
#### I’ve heard people say that Buddhism is more a way of life than a religion. Did the Buddha teach a way of life, a religion, or a philosophy?
- Buddhism takes a pragmatic approach to tackling the challenge immediately at hand: that in life, difficulties arise and we experience suffering, much as we would if shot by a poison arrow. The Buddha taught that the wise thing to do is not to spend time and energy focusing on irrelevant details but to remove the arrow. Rather than trying to answer these existential questions, Buddhism urges us to look inward and ask ourselves, “Why do I feel the need to know these things?” (Location 231)
#### Is there a Buddhist Bible or other authoritative text that all Buddhists use?
#### You’ve mentioned various “schools” of Buddhism. What are the major types of Buddhism?
#### EVERYDAY BUDDHISM The Evolution of Ideas
- The Buddha said that the greatest of all teachings is the teaching of impermanence. How could Buddhism possibly stay the same in a world that’s constantly changing? You can learn something from all the various Buddhist traditions, finding which teachings ring true for you and resonate with your specific personality or learning style. And as you change, your practice can change with you. (Location 274)
#### What are the main differences between Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana Buddhism?
#### I hear the word Zen used a lot when people talk about Buddhism. What is Zen?
#### How did Buddhism come to the West?
### PART 2 CORE CONCEPTS
#### The Buddha became a great teacher after he became enlightened. But what is enlightenment? Can anyone become enlightened?
- The Buddhist conception of enlightenment isn’t intellectual. It’s experiential. It’s kind of like being a parent: If I went back in time and tried to explain to my younger self what it feels like to be a dad, nothing I could say would adequately convey it. I couldn’t imagine what it would feel like to be a dad until I actually became one. (Location 323)
    - Note: Note on experential learning
- enlightenment is also freedom from wanting to be enlightened. (Location 329)
#### What about the word awakening? Is it different from enlightenment?
- In a way, you become awakened the moment you realize you don’t need to become awakened—everything you need to know is already present within you. (Location 344)
- What does Buddhism teach about good and evil? (Location 346)
- Rather than thinking of evil as an external agent acting upon us, Buddhism teaches that greed, hatred, and ignorance are the sources of what we typically think of as “evil.” In Buddhism, these three qualities are called “the three poisons” or “the three fires.” (Location 350)
#### Why does Buddhism consider ignorance to be a poison? What’s wrong with not knowing things?
- The most dangerous manifestation of ignorance is the belief in a permanent self that exists independent of other people and the rest of the world. Clinging to this false, or ignorant, sense of self and wanting to protect it give rise to greed and hatred. (Location 359)
#### Why is greed considered to be a poison? Is it wrong to desire things like good food or a nice car?
- A skillful way of dealing with the poison of greed is to try to understand it. We start that process by looking at the things we desire and asking ourselves, “Why?” Why do I feel such a strong desire to have this thing or that person? Why do I feel the need to achieve this or that? It’s not that there’s anything inherently wrong with the feeling of desire; it’s that we can become blinded by it, especially when we don’t have a thorough understanding of the intent or causes behind why we feel what we feel. (Location 373)
- Simply following our desires without taking time to understand them can lead to destructive behavior and mental confusion, which is why greed is considered a poison. (Location 377)
#### Why is hatred considered to be a poison? Is it wrong to ever feel hate?
- Rather than evading the painful truth of how we feel, Buddhism encourages us to embrace the reality of our feelings, including any feelings of hatred we might be experiencing. (Location 388)
