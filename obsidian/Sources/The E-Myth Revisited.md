## Metadata
- Author: [[Michael Gerber]]
- Full Title: The E-Myth Revisited

## Highlights
- So before you start your business, or before you return to it tomorrow, ask yourself the following questions:  
  - What do I wish my life to look like?
  - How do I wish my life to be on a day-to-day basis?
  - What would I like to be able to say I truly know in my life, about my life?
  - How would I like to be with other people in my life—my family, my friends, my business associates, my customers, my employees, my community?
  - How would I like people to think about me?
  - What would I like to be doing two years from now? Ten years from now? Twenty years from now? When my life comes to a close?
  - What specifically would I like to learn during my life—spiritually, physically, financially, technically, intellectually? About relationships?
  - How much money will I need to do the things I wish to do? By when will I need it? (Location 2143)

- In that regard, your Primary Aim is the vision necessary to bring your business to life and your life to your business. It provides you with a purpose. It provides you with energy. It provides you with the grist for your day-to-day mill. (Location 2155)
