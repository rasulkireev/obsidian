## Metadata
- Author: [[Ryan Holiday]]
- Full Title: The Obstacle Is the Way

## Highlights
- Every obstacle is unique to each of us. But the responses they elicit are the same: Fear. Frustration. Confusion. Helplessness. Depression. Anger. (Location 162)
- There are a few things to keep in mind when faced with a seemingly insurmountable obstacle. We must try: To be objective To control emotions and keep an even keel To choose to see the good in a situation To steady our nerves To ignore what disturbs or limits others To place things in perspective To revert to the present moment To focus on what can be controlled (Location 362)
- And what is up to us? 
  Our emotions 
  Our judgments 
  Our creativity 
  Our attitude 
  Our perspective 
  Our desires 
  Our decisions 
  Our determination (Location 695)
