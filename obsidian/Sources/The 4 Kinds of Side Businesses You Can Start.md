## Highlights
- as far as i’ve thought about it, i think there are 4 ways you can build a successful side hustle:
  buy an existing asset
  launch a product on a marketplace with existing demand
  launch a unique, one of a kind product in a new space where you can buy demand (adwords, facebook, etc.)
  arbitrage (craigslist, airbnb, trading, uber)
- if i were to start another side business now, the platforms i’d look at are:
  skillshare / udemy
  ebay / amazon
  amazon ebooks
  the shopify app store
  the google chrome app store
  any sort of niche marketplace where people buy stuff: wordpress themes, woocommerce themes, etc.
  airbnb
