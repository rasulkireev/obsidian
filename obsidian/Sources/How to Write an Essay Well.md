## Highlights
- Leverage
  If you have something important to say and you say it well, you send strangers down paths they badly needed.
  That's why it’s a disservice to humanity to keep your great thoughts to yourself. Especially when you consider the scale of writing: articles reach thousands.
  Writing is the most radical thing you can do without money. Skilled writers change the world from their couch.
  That’s leverage.
- If you can think clearly, you can generate something to say.
- Becoming a better writer makes you a better all-around thinker. You learn to communicate more clearly and more persuasively.

- The most efficient way to meet interesting people is to become someone they already want to meet.
  How? Do cool things and blog about it. Or podcast about it. Or record videos.
  When you produce content with an authentic voice, people want to meet the person behind that voice.
