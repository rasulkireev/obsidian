## Highlights
- A Zettelkasten makes connecting and not collecting a priority.
- Create one Zettel per thought.
- As you connect, you will learn, understand, and thus expand yourself in two ways: (a) Your knowledge will increase and (b) you will be a better observer. By being a better observer, you will be able to draw more insights from observation. More universal patterns arise and become more apparent to you. A fundamental aspect of working like this is that it allows you to access the general patterns of reality.

    - Note: Read with an intention of making connections. This has many hidden benefits, like better learning and more insightful observations.
- If you just add links without any explanation you will not create knowledge.
