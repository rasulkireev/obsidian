- Author: [[Alex Hillman]]

## Highlights
- Each page of this book is relatively self contained. When one of the pages catches your eye, let yourself sit with it for 30 seconds to a minute.Think, and reﬂect. (Page 1)
    - Note: JFS book has a whole section about this.
- If you really want to get the most out of it, try taking notes along with each page in a journal or notepad (Page 1)
- Here are some questions that might help you reﬂect: “How do the words on this page make me feel?” “Have I seen or experienced this myself? Why or why not?” “What can I do or try, even if it’s uncomfortable? “How is this diﬀerent (Page 1)
- Most people pay way too much attention to things that do not matter to their customers: things like press, awards, drama, and hype. (Page 1)
- Brand can be a valuable business, but creating a brand is not a frst step for starting a business. It’s not even one of the frst 200 steps (Page 2)
    - Note: Is it the product itself then?
- Every minute you spend chasing investors is time you could... (Page 15)
    - Note: You have to earn the money.
      You should ask your customers for money. Why add a step of asking fr money to earn more money.

- People don’t pay you because they like you. They pay you because you generate some kind of economic value or upside elsewhere in a system that matters to them. If you learn how that system works, you can fgure out how to make more money (Page 21)
    - Note: It's important to remember that we are all different and value means something different to each.
- Freelancing with several clients, or a product business with hundreds or thousands of clients, is so much safer than a job (as long as you treat it like a business and not a hobby). No one client or customer can own you, or subsequently, ruin you (Page 25)
    - Note: Treat it like business part is interesting. This is not for fun, but for survival.
- Few things are more satisfying than the freedom to fre an aggressive or toxic client/ customer because you know they only make up a small % of your revenue and can easily be replaced with someone who is kind and appreciative (Page 26)
    - Note: Being in power of your life (certain components) is hard, but life changing.
- Most long term success doesn’t look anything like success in the beginning. Or even in the middle (Page 32)
    - Note: So, hkw then can one determin whether to stick/continue or not.
- Most success you see is the result of being able to do the right thing long enough (Page 33)
    - Note: Habits!
- Being willing to repeat yourself is a massively underrated way to succeed (Page 36)
    - Note: What does this mean?
      Does Alex mean that patnce is the key?
- An inability to cope with boredom kills more successes than any kind of competition (Page 37)
    - Note: To me, this means, that a person needs to have a plan, so he never thinks what to do when he iks bored.
- Before you ask “what can I do to make more money,” try asking “who can I reach that has money to spend?” Try to name specifc people and businesses instead of broad categories. Treat this list like a brainstorm, except instead of brainstorming ideas, you’re brainstorming customers you can servealex hillman 42 the tiny mba (Page 42)
    - Note: If I can't name any? What is the first action to take?

- It is also important to realize other people (and businesses) spend money diﬀerently than you do. Odds are that you will underprice yourself because you set prices based on what you would pay, not what they already spend (Page 43)
    - Note: One of the most important learnings is that we are all very different.
- It’s infnitely easier to get people to change where they already spend money than it is to convince them to spend new money, or even spend money in a new (Page 44)
    - Note: Does that mean it is easier to steal customers from competition?
- It’s infnitely easier to get people to change where they already spend money than it is to convince them to spend new money, or even (Page 44)
- It’s infnitely easier to get people to change where they already spend money than it is to convince them to spend new money, or even spend money in a new way (Page 44)
- If you fnd something that works in your business, do it again. And again. And again. And again.Eventually, delegate or automate it. Then set a reminder to check in once a quarter to make sure that thing is still working, and/or isn’t creating other unintended consequences (Page 48)
    - Note: First, you need to find that thing.
