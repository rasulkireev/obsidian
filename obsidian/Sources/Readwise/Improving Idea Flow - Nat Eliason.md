## Highlights
- A way to test if your ideas are uninteresting is how much you align with certain people, or certain schools of thought. The fewer memetic buckets you scoop from, the more your ideas will align with those buckets. The simplest example of this is considering yourself a Republican or Democrat. If your ideas fully converge with the talking points of either party, then you haven't thought those ideas out that much. Or if you love everything Nassim Taleb says and agree with him on pretty much everything, you haven't diversified your inputs enough.
- Go through your Twitter, Feedly, Podcast, or YouTube feed and see what sources are saying the same things in different ways. Now of those, which are your favorites. Keep one or two, and ditch the rest.
- One method is to cut out the middlemen. If you're interested in health, learn how to read research papers in medical journals. Any blog post or news story starts with a research paper, and frequently interprets it wrong, so knowing how to find and study the source material saves time and improves understanding.
- Having conversations helps you hone the ideas that are starting to form. It forces you to try to explain them on the fly, realize where they're faulty, and then continue annealing them in subsequent conversations.
- Creating is the final expression of an idea. Whether your ideas express themselves in articles, tweets, songs, paintings, TikToks, you must turn them into something to truly clarify them.

- If you're not in the habit of creating things from your ideas, your ideas are never forced into some kind of coherency. They never become memes: idea-viruses that can reproduce in the brains of other people.

- The best writing is the writing you don't care if anyone reads. It's what you create to help yourself understand and clarify what's bouncing around in your head. If someone reads and finds value in it, great, but simply by creating it you've gotten most of the value.‍
