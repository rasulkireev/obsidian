### Chapter 1 A Pragmatic Philosophy
#### Topic 1    It’s Your Life
- Tip 3    You Have Agency (Location 500)
    - Tags: [[tip]]
    - Note: you are responsible for your life and you have everything you might need to change that.
#### Topic 2    The Cat Ate My Source Code
- The greatest of all weaknesses is the fear of appearing weak.         J.B. Bossuet, Politics from Holy Writ, 1709 (Location 522)
    - Tags: [[weakness]][[fear]][[quote]]
- These things happen, and we try to deal with them as professionally as we can. This means being honest and direct. (Location 529)
    - Tags: [[integrity]][[trust]]
- Tip 4    Provide Options, Don’t Make Lame Excuses (Location 555)
    - Note: Excuses are useless, if you made a mostake yoj better come up with the solution .
- When you find yourself saying, “I don’t know,” be sure to follow it up with “—but I’ll find out.” It’s a great way to admit what you don’t know, but then take responsibility like a pro. (Location 588)
#### Topic 3    Software Entropy
- Tip 5    Don’t Live with Broken Windows (Location 620)
    - Note: Dont allow any technical debt in your project. As soon as there is one piece of debt, soon the next will begin.
##### FIRST, DO NO HARM
#### Topic 4    Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs
- People find it easier to join an ongoing success. Show them a glimpse of the future and you’ll get them to rally around. (Location 698)
- Tip 6    Be a Catalyst for Change (Location 701)
    - Tags: [[tip]]
    - Note: When you projecy or any big change requires a lot of resources, try to prokduce som.etghing functiolnal that will iknterest them. Then ask for resource, and add to your project. Do this until complete
##### THE VILLAGERS’ SIDE
- Tip 7    Remember the Big Picture (Location 711)
    - Tags: [[tip]]
    - Note: projects often go out of scope. Try to keep the original wndgoal in mind. There is nothing wrong woth chanhe, just make sure it is intentional
#### Topic 5    Good-Enough Software
- As Ed Yourdon described in an article in IEEE Software, When good-enough software is best [You95], you can discipline yourself to write software that’s good enough—good enough for your users, for future maintainers, for your own peace of mind. You’ll find that you are more productive and your users are happier. And you may well find that your programs are actually better for their shorter incubation. (Location 753)

##### INVOLVE YOUR USERS IN THE TRADE-OFF
- Tip 8    Make Quality a Requirements Issue (Location 774)
    - Tags: [[tip]]
    - Note: Things are never perfect in real world. Quality should be discussed before the project begins.
##### KNOW WHEN TO STOP
- But artists will tell you that all the hard work is ruined if you don’t know when to stop. If you add layer upon layer, detail over detail, the painting becomes lost in the paint. Don’t spoil a perfectly good program by overembellishment and overrefinement. (Location 789)
#### Topic 6    Your Knowledge Portfolio
- An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest.         Benjamin Franklin (Location 820)
    - Tags: [[quote]]
- Your ability to learn new things is your most important strategic asset. (Location 832)
##### YOUR KNOWLEDGE PORTFOLIO
##### BUILDING YOUR PORTFOLIO
- Invest regularly (Location 850)
    - Tags: [[h4]]
- The more different things you know, the more valuable you are. As a baseline, you need to know the ins and outs of the particular technology you are working with currently. (Location 854)
- Manage risk (Location 860)
    - Tags: [[h4]]
- Buy low, sell high (Location 864)
    - Tags: [[h4]]
- Learning an emerging technology before it becomes popular can be just as hard as finding an undervalued stock, but the payoff can be just as rewarding. (Location 865)
- Review and rebalance (Location 867)
    - Tags: [[h4]]
- Tip 9    Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio (Location 873)
    - Tags: [[tip]]
##### GOALS
- Learn at least one new language every year Different languages solve the same problems in different ways. By learning several different approaches, you can help broaden your thinking and avoid getting stuck in a rut. (Location 879)
- Read a technical book each month (Location 883)
##### OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEARNING
##### CRITICAL THINKING
- Tip 10    Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear (Location 933)
    - Tags: [[tip]]
- Critical thinking is an entire discipline unto itself, and we encourage you to read and study all you can about it. (Location 937)
- Ask the “Five Whys” A favorite consulting trick: ask “why?” at least five times. Ask a question, and get an answer. Dig deeper by asking “why?” Repeat as if you were a petulant four-year old (but a polite one). You might be able to get closer to a root cause this way. (Location 939)
- Who does this benefit? It may sound cynical, but follow the money can be a very helpful path to analyze. The benefits to someone else or another organization may be aligned with your own, or not. (Location 942)
#### Topic 7    Communicate!
- Tip 11    English is Just Another Programming Language (Location 992)
    - Tags: [[tip]]
##### KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE
- As with all forms of communication, the trick here is to gather feedback. Don’t just wait for questions: ask for them. Look at body language, and facial expressions. One of the Neuro Linguistic Programming presuppositions is “The meaning of your communication is the response you get.” Continuously improve your knowledge of your audience as you communicate. (Location 1007)
    - Tags: [[communication]][[nlp]]
##### KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY
- When you’re faced with an important meeting or a chat with a major client, jot down the ideas you want to communicate, and plan a couple of strategies for getting them across. (Location 1019)
##### CHOOSE YOUR MOMENT
##### CHOOSE A STYLE
##### MAKE IT LOOK GOOD
##### INVOLVE YOUR AUDIENCE
##### BE A LISTENER
##### GET BACK TO PEOPLE
- Tip 12    It’s Both What You Say and the Way You Say It (Location 1061)
    - Tags: [[tip]]
##### DOCUMENTATION
- Writing documentation can be made easier by not duplicating effort or wasting time, and by keeping documentation close at hand—in the code itself. (Location 1071)
    - Tags: [[question]]
    - Note: Do you mean commenting code or keeping a README?
- Tip 13    Build Documentation In, Don’t Bolt It On (Location 1074)
    - Note: It is easy tol generate pretty docs from comments
##### SUMMARY
- Know what you want to say. Know your audience. Choose your moment. Choose a style. Make it look good. Involve your audience. Be a listener. Get back to people. Keep code and documentation together. (Location 1089)
##### CHALLENGES
- There are several good books that contain sections on communications within teams, including The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering [Bro96] and Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams [DL13]. (Location 1131)
    - Tags: [[book]]
- In addition, Dinosaur Brains: Dealing with All Those Impossible People at Work [BR89] discusses the emotional baggage we all bring to the work environment. (Location 1136)
    - Tags: [[book]]
### Chapter 2 A Pragmatic Approach
#### Topic 8    The Essence of Good Design
### Chapter 3 The Basic Tools
#### Topic 16    The Power of Plain Text
- Tip 25    Keep Knowledge in Plain Text (Location 3258)
##### THE POWER OF TEXT
- Insurance Against Obsolescence (Location 3268)
    - Tags: [[h4]]
- Leverage (Location 3321)
    - Tags: [[h4]]
- Easier Testing (Location 3342)
    - Tags: [[h4]]
##### LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR
#### Topic 17    Shell Games
- A benefit of GUIs is WYSIWYG—what you see is what you get. The disadvantage is WYSIAYG—what you see is all you get. (Location 3386)
- Tip 26    Use the Power of Command Shells (Location 3396)
    - Tags: [[tip]]
##### A SHELL OF YOUR OWN
##### CHALLENGES
- Investigate alternatives to your current shell. If you come across a problem your shell can’t address, see if an alternative shell would cope better. (Location 3467)
    - Note: What shells are there? How are they different ?
#### Topic 18    Power Editing
- Tip 27    Achieve Editor Fluency (Location 3480)
    - Tags: [[tip]]
##### WHAT DOES “FLUENT” MEAN?
##### MOVING TOWARD FLUENCY
- First, look at yourself while you’re editing. Every time you find yourself doing something repetitive, get into the habit of thinking “there must be a better way.” Then find it. (Location 3516)
    - Tags: [[tip]]
    - Note: Getting better at editting
- Growing Your Editor (Location 3521)
    - Tags: [[h4]]
- Dig into your editor’s extension language. Work out how to use it to automate some of the repetitive things you do. Often you’ll just need a line or two of code. (Location 3527)
#### Topic 19    Version Control
##### IT STARTS AT THE SOURCE
##### BRANCHING OUT
##### VERSION CONTROL AS A PROJECT HUB
##### CHALLENGES
- Spend some time thinking about recovering your own laptop environment in case of a disaster. What would you need to recover? Many of the things you need are just text files. If they’re not in a VCS (hosted off your laptop), find a way to add them. Then think about the other stuff: installed applications, system configuration, and so on. How can you express all that stuff in text files so it, too, can be saved? An interesting experiment, once you’ve made some progress, is to find an old computer you no longer use and see if your new system can be used to set it up. (Location 3668)

##### Topic 20    Debugging
- The word bug has been used to describe an “object of terror’’ ever since the fourteenth century. Rear Admiral Dr. Grace Hopper, the inventor of COBOL, is credited with observing the first computer bug—literally, a moth caught in a relay in an early computer system. When asked to explain why the machine wasn’t behaving as intended, a technician reported that there was “a bug in the system,” and dutifully taped it—wings and all—into the log book. (Location 3688)
- No one writes perfect software, so it’s a given that debugging will take up a major portion of your day. (Location 3699)
##### PSYCHOLOGY OF DEBUGGING
- Debugging is a sensitive, emotional subject for many developers. Instead of attacking it as a puzzle to be solved, you may encounter denial, finger pointing, lame excuses, or just plain apathy. Embrace the fact that debugging is just problem solving, and attack it as such. (Location 3702)
- Embrace (Location 3704)
##### Tip 29    Fix the Problem, Not the Blame
##### A DEBUGGING MINDSET
- Above all, remember the first rule of debugging: Tip 30    Don’t Panic (Location 3717)
    - Tags: [[tip]]
- If your first reaction on witnessing a bug or seeing a bug report is “that’s impossible,” you are plainly wrong. Don’t waste a single neuron on the train of thought that begins “but that can’t happen” because quite clearly it can, and has. (Location 3725)
##### WHERE TO START
- You may need to interview the user who reported the bug in order to gather more data than you were initially given. (Location 3749)
##### DEBUGGING STRATEGIES
- Reproducing Bugs (Location 3759)
    - Tags: [[h4]]
##### CODER IN A STRANGE LAND
##### THE BINARY CHOP
- A very simple but particularly useful technique for finding the cause of a problem is simply to explain it to someone else. The other person should look over your shoulder at the screen, and nod his or her head constantly (like a rubber duck bobbing up and down in a bathtub). They do not need to say a word; the simple act of explaining, step by step, what the code is supposed to do often causes the problem to leap off the screen and announce itself.[26] (Location 3848)
    - Note: Writing down the explanation also works
#### Topic 21    Text Manipulation
- Tip 35    Learn a Text Manipulation Language (Location 3956)

#### Topic 22    Engineering Daybooks
### Chapter 4 Pragmatic Paranoia
