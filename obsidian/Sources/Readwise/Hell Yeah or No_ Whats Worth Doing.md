#### Why are you doing?
- doing. Most people don’t know. They just go with the fow. Social norms are powerful. The inputs that infuence you are powerful. A great talk, book, or video can instantly change how you think. But on your death bed, you don’t want that horrible regret, feeling like you spent your life pursuing what someone said you should want, instead of what you actually wanted. For example, if you want to make a lot of money, you need to admit that. If you want to be famous, you need to pursue that. If you want freedom and no responsibilities, or want to learn as much as possible, or whatever else, you need to realize it and embrace it. Whatever you decide, you need to optimize for that goal, and be willing to let go of the others. You can’t diffuse your energy, trying to do a little bit of everything, or you’ll always be in confict with yourself. For example, one way to make money is to take on a lot of responsibility, which means letting go of some freedoms.

I learned this while living in Los Angeles, when I got to know some famous Hollywood actors and realized they’re not as rich as you’d think. The richest people in Hollywood are the ones you’ve never heard of, because they’ve optimized their careers for money. They know that others are willing to take less money in return for more fame, so they proft from the sivers.org/why 11 (Page 20)

#### Loving what I used to hate
- Be careful when you say you like or dislike something, because you could change your mind soon (Page 26)

- It didn’t matter where they were before. What mattered was the direction they were headed (Page 30)
- How you do anything is how you do everything. It all matters. Your actions are completely under your control, and seem to be the best indicator of future success (Page 30)
