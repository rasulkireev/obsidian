## Highlights
- Here’s an example. I read for ~1 hour every morning, and read more in the evenings, in transit, on the weekend, etc. On the one hand, that’s leisure time. But on the other, it’s productive, since most of the time I’m reading a book for Made You Think, and at the very least I’m going to publish my notes on it.
- Each month, I’ll pick three goals to focus on.
-  I will not do anything in the Good to Do until the Top Priority tasks are done
- You won’t need to do silly things like the pomodoro technique, you’ll just do the work
- And since I clean out my inbox at the end of the day, I’ll rarely need to respond to anything before noon, which means I can do my morning deep work without checking email at all, or just peaking at it to make sure there are no fires.
- I’ve found the ROI on time spent in books much higher (if you disagree, read better books)
- The goal of the review is three-fold:
  Assess the day
  Clear the slate from today
  Plan the next day
- I try to ask myself each week: “what’s the biggest constraint on my output right now,” based on the book The Goal. I find this helps a lot with framing my goals for the next week, by making me focus on where my time is being wasted and I could be delegating, automating, or not doing work that I should be doing.
