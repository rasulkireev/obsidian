### Introduction The Champions as Symbols of their Time
### Chapter One Chess before Steinitz
- The stages in the development of chess resemble the path taken by everyone who proceeds from a beginner to a player of high standard (Location 274)
    - Note: Did we reach our peak?
- ‘Pawns are the soul of chess; on their correct or bad arrangement depends the success of attack or defence; the art of playing with them decides the fate of the game.’ (Location 313)
- If you have a light-squared bishop, you should place your pawns on dark squares; if a dark-squared bishop, then on light squares. Since then your bishop will prevent the enemy pieces from establishing themselves between your pawns.’ One of the classic rules of Philidor, which was later adopted by Steinitz (Location 334)

- Philidor discovered the eternal principle of the coordination of the forces – ‘genuine attacks are carried out by the united efforts of many pieces’ (in this respect his best pupil was Morphy) (Location 341)
- 1. ‘An attack should never be begun before the pawns leading it are thoroughly supported’ (and they should be deployed in a compact chain – a phalanx). (Location 343)
- 2. ‘Pawns, especially central ones, that have advanced to the fifth rank, lose part of their strength, since then they can easily be attacked by the enemy pawns from the sixth rank’ (a direct panegyric upon the Alekhine Defence!). (Location 345)
- 3. ‘It is always advantageous to exchange your f-pawn for the e-pawn, since this leads to the seizure of the centre and, in addition, to the opening of a file for the rook’ (the ideology of the King’s Gambit and an opening of the 19th century – the Vienna Game). (Location 347)
- The First Matches for the Crown (Location 359)
- In 1833 he published a manual New treatise on the game of chess (also published later in Russia), where for the first time advice was given on how to work independently with a chess book and learn to calculate variations in the mind (Location 368)
