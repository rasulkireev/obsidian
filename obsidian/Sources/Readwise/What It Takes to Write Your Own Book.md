## Highlights
- Before going into the process of writing, make sure you know why you’re doing it.
- If you’re stuck, start journaling
- If you aren’t excited about it, either get excited or write something else. If you aren’t excited, the reader won’t be either.
- Turn on Freedom
- Add stories, analogies, and metaphors; try to paint pictures to make it easier to understand 
- Define exactly who you’re writing the book for.
- Don’t start writing until you have an outline.

- If I were to start again today, the first thing I would do is create a document consisting of who the book is for, a rough outline, and the promise of the book, and show that to 5 people I wanted to read the book and keep tweaking it until they were excited to read it.
- If you aren’t excited about it, don’t write it
- Book writing is the most creatively draining activity I’ve ever done
