- Therefore, Lucilius, do as you write me that you are doing: hold every hour in your grasp. Lay hold of today’s task, and you (Page 17)
- What man can you show me who places any value on his time, who reckons the worth of each day, who understands that he is dying daily? For we are mistaken when we look forward to death; the major portion of death has already passed. Whatever years be behind us are in death’s hands. Therefore, Lucilius, do as you (Page 17)
- Death arrives; it would be a thing to dread, if it could remain with you. But death must either not come at all, or else must come and pass away (Page 26)
- We can get rid of most sins, if we have a witness who stands near us when we are likely to go wrong (Page 54)
- Death, however, should be looked in the face by young and old alike. We are not summoned according to our rating on the censor’s list. [5] Moreover, no one is so old that it would be improper for him to hope for another day of existence (Page 63)
- adage and avoid three things with (Page 74)
- And finally, the wise man regards the reason for all his actions, but not the results. The beginning is in our own power; fortune decides the issue, but I do not allow her to pass sentence upon myself (Page 76)
- you how its use and enjoyment may bring you greater pleasure. “He who needs riches least, enjoys riches most.” [8] “Author’s name, please!” you (Page 76)
- He who needs riches least, enjoys riches most. (Page 76)

- While he puzzles over increasing his wealth, he forgets how to use (Page 77)
- No man, however, enjoys a blessing that brings anxiety; he is always trying to add a little more. While he puzzles over increasing his wealth, he forgets how to use it (Page 77)
- Here is the proverb; it is an excellent one: “The fool’s life is empty of gratitude and full of fears; its course lies wholly toward the future (Page 80)
- Therefore continually remind yourself, Lucilius, how many ambitions you have attained. When you see many ahead of you, think how many are behind! If you would thank the gods, and be grateful for your past life, you should contemplate how many men (Page 80)

- therefore, from idle things, and when you would know whether (Page 85)
- philosophy teaches us to act, not to speak; it exacts of every man that he should live according to his own standards, that his life should not be out of harmony with his words, and that, further, his inner life should be of one hue and not out of harmony with all his activities (Page 100)
- This, I say, is the highest duty and the highest proof of wisdom—that deed and word should be in accord, that a man should be equal to himself under all conditions, and always the same (Page 100)
- Men do not care how nobly they live, but only how long, although it is within the reach of every man to live nobly, but within no man’s power to live long. Farewell. (Page 113)
- Do you suppose that I shall write you how kindly the winter season has dealt with us—a short season and a mild one—or what a nasty spring we are having—cold weather out of season—and all the other trivialities which people write when they are at a loss for topics of conversation? No (Page 115)
- On the Futility of Learning Maxims (Page 156)
- What then? Shall I not follow in the footsteps of my predecessors? I shall indeed use the old road, but if I find one that makes a shorter cut and is smoother to travel, I shall open the new road. Men who have made these discoveries before us are not our masters, but our guides. Truth lies open for all; it has not yet been monopolized. And there is plenty of it left even for posterity to discover. Farewell (Page 159)
- But although virtues, when admitted, cannot depart and are easy to guard, yet the first steps in the approach to them are toilsome, because it is characteristic of a weak and diseased mind to fear that which is unfamiliar. The mind must, therefore, be forced to make a beginning; from then on, the medicine is not bitter; for just as soon as it is curing us it begins to give pleasure. One enjoys other cures only after health is restored, but a draught of philosophy is at the same moment wholesome and pleasant. Farewell (Page 222)
