## Highlights
### CHAPTER 1 Introduction: Stab. Stab, Stab
#### CHEATERS OCCASIONALLY PROSPER:

THE THREE KEYS TO LANGUAGE LEARNING
- I encountered three basic keys to language learning:
  1. Learn pronunciation first.
  2. Don't translate.
  3. Use spaced repetition systems. (Page 4)
### CHAPTER 2 Upload: Five Principles to End Forgetting
#### PRINCIPLE 1: MAKE MEMORIES MORE MEMORABLE
- These are the four levels of processing. They were identified in the 1970s by psychologists who created a curious questionnaire with four types of questions and gave it to college students:
  Structure: How many capital letters are in the word BEAR?
  Sound: Does APPLE rhyme with Snapple?
  Concept: Is TOOL another word for "instrument"?
  Personal Connection: Do you like PIZZA? (Page 20)
    - Note: Using four of these will help you remember words better
##### How to Remember a Foreign Word Forever
- Given this phenomenon, how do we make a strange, foreign word like mjöður memorable? The word itself is not the problem. We are not bad at remembering words when they are tied to concrete, multisensory experiences. If I tell you that my email password is mjöður, you probably (hopefully?) won't remember it, because you're processing it on a sound and structural level. But if we're in a bar together, and I you, hand you a flaming drink with a dead snake in it, and tell "Thismjöður! You-drink!" you won't have any trouble remembering that word. (Page 23)
##### Breaking Through the Filter: The Power of Images and Personal Connections
- We'll get better results if we skip the English word and use an image instead.
  We recall images much better than words, because we automatically think conceptually when we see an image. Image-recall studies have repeatedly demonstrated that our visual memory is phenomenal. (Page 24)
    - Note: Study example is attached
- • Your brain is a sophisticated filter, which makes irrelevant information forgettable and meaningful information memorable. Foreign words tend to fall into the "forgettable" category, because they sound odd, they don't seem particularly meaningful, and they don't have any connection to your own life experiences.
  • You can get around this filter and make foreign words memorable by doing three things:
  • Learn the sound system of your language 
  • Bind those sounds to images
  • Bind those images to your past experiences (Page 27)

#### PRINCIPLE 2: MAXIMIZE LAZINESS
- • Rote repetition is boring, and it doesn't work for long-term memorization.
  • Take the lazy route instead: study a concept until you can repeat it once without looking and then stop. After all, lazy is just another word for "efficient." (Page 29)

#### PRINCIPLE 3: DON'T REVIEW. RECALL.
- • Acts of recall set off an intricate chemical dance in your brain that boosts memory retention.
  • To maximize efficiency, spend most of your time recalling rather than reviewing.
  • You'll accomplish this goal by creating flash cards that test your ability to recall a given word, pronunciation, or grammatical construction. Coupled with images and personal connections, these cards will form the foundation of a powerful memorization system. (Page 33)

#### PRINCIPLE 4: WAIT, WAIT! DON'T TELL ME!
- • Memory tests are most effective when they're challenging. The closer you get to forgetting a word, the more ingrained it will become when you finally remember it.
  • If you can consistently test yourself right before you forget, you'll double the effectiveness of every test. (Page 35)

#### PRINCIPLE 5: REWRITE THE PAST
- When we remember, we don't just access our memories; we rewrite them. Prompted by the popcorn advertisement, these college students remembered movie nights at home, the smell of corn and butter, the crunch in their mouths, and the salt on their lips. In the midst of reliving these experiences, they saw images of other people enjoying popcorn in bags marked "Orville Redenbacher's Gourmet Fresh," and their memories changed. The network of neurons from past movie nights activated at the same time as they saw the brand's logo. Because neurons that fire together wire together, their brains stored these new connections as if they had always been there. (Page 37)
- • Every time you successfully recall a memory, you revisit and rewrite earlier experiences, adding bits and pieces of your present self to your past memories.
  • You'll make the best use of your time when practicing recall if your earlier experiences are as memorable as possible. You can accomplish this by connecting sounds, images, and personal connections to every word you learn.
  •When you do forget, use immediate feedback to bring back your forgotten memories. (Page 39)

#### TIMING IS EVERYTHING: THE END OF FORGETTING
- If you read someone else's gato flash card, you probably won't spontaneously think of your childhood cat or of the numerous Shrek: Puss in Boots (Gato con Botas) images that show up on a Google Images search for the word. There's no movie, no sound, and no story. Under these circumstances, you'll be hard-pressed to form a deep, multisensory memory while you're busily studying on the way to work. This isn't the SRS's fault; it's in the nature of the language game. (Page 45)
    - Note: Do flashcards yourself. Only you will have the emotional connection with images and words.
- This last point is the deadly one. As soon as your daily reviews become frustrating, it gets harder and harder to sit down and do them.
  You may be able to force yourself to stick with it for a few weeks, but no.
  you need longer than that to see major results. This becomes a vicious cycle, because frustration impedes your ability to remember, which puts the frustrating cards in front of you more often, which eventually causes you to throw your smartphone out of the nearest window. (Page 47)
    - Note: With things that take time to learn you need to make sure that you enjoy them, otherwise you won't be able to push through. You need to have fun.
- • Spaced repetition systems (SRSS) are flash cards on steroids. They supercharge memorization by automatically monitoring your progress and using that information to design a daily, customized to-do list of new words to learn and old words to review. (Page 48)

#### Do THIS NoW: LEARN TO USE A SPACED REPETITION SYSTEM (SRS)
- Third, the process of finding images for computerized flash cards is one of the most powerful learning experiences you could ever hope for. Again, your brain sucks in images like a sponge. Just a few seconds browsing through twenty dog images will create a powerful, lasting memory. Even if you're using physical flash cards, don't pass up the opportunity to learn your words through Google Images. (Page 51)
    - Note: While you are looking for images, words get engraved in your brain.
### CHAPTER 3 Sound Play
#### TRAIN YOUR EARS, REWIRE YOUR BRAIN
- At the edge of the North Sea, a German coastguard officer waits at his radio.
  "*Kshht* Mayday! Mayday! Hello, can you hear us? We are sinking!"
  "Ja, hallo! Zis is ze German coastguard!"
  "We are sinking! We are sinking!"
  "OK. Vat are you sinkink about?"
  -Berlitz advertisement (Page 57)

- The world's languages contain roughly 800 phonemes (six hundred consonants and two hundred vowels). Most languages choose around 4,0 of these to form their words, although the range is quite broadthere's a neat language called Rotokas in Papua New Guinea with only 11 phonemes, and Taa, spoken in Botswana, uses up to 112 (plus four tones!). (Page 58)
- The best data we have on this process come from studies of Americans and the Japanese. By using brain scans, researchers can see whether an individual can hear the difference between any two sounds. An American adult listening to a monotonous "rock. . .rock...rock...rock...lock" will show a sudden spike in brain activity when "lock" breaks the monotony, but a Japanese adult won't show any change whatsoever. A Japanese baby, however, has no trouble whatsoever recognizing the two sounds, an ability that gradually vanishes between six and twelve months of age. (Page 59)
- When you use minimal pair testing at the beginning of your language journey, you'll learn much faster in the long run. You'll have an easier time remembering new words, because they no longer sound foreign.
  You'll also understand native speakers better, because your ears are in sync with their speech. Instead of wasting your time correcting bad pronunciation habits, you'll be able to spend your time consuming language at breakneck speed. (Page 62)
- • Your brain is hardwired to ignore the differences between foreign sounds. To rewire it, listen to minimal pairs in your target language similar sounding words like niece and knees-and test yourself until brain adapts to hear these new sounds.
  • By practicing in this way, you'll be better equipped to recognize words when they're spoken, and you'll have an easier time memorizing them on your own (Page 64)

#### TRAIN YOUR MOUTH, GET THE GIRL
- An accurate accent is powerful because it is the ultimate gesture of empathy. It connects you to another person's culture in a way that words never can, because you have bent your body as well as your mind to match that person's culture. Anyone can learn "bawn-JURE" in a few seconds. To learn how bonjour fits into your companion's mouth and tongue; to learn how to manipulate the muscles, the folds, and even the texture of your throat and lips to match your companion'sthis is an unmistakable, undeniable, and irresistible gesture of care. (Page 65)
- • Impressions matter, and your accent makes your first impression in any language. A good accent can make the difference between a conversation that starts in French and ends in English, and a full conversation in French.
  • Improve your accent by learning the raw ingredients-the tongue, lip, and vocal cord positions-of every new sound you need. You can find that information in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).
  • If you run into difficult combinations of sounds, back-chain them together until your tongue performs automatically. (Page 70)
#### TRAIN YOUR EYES, SEE THE PATTERNS
- As long as I could connect every new thing I learned to this universe, I had an easy time with math. And I noticed that classmates who had problems with math weren't struggling with math; they were struggling with connections. They were trying to memorize equations, but no one had successfully shown them how those equations connect with everything they had already learned. (Page 75)
- • Every language contains a pattern of connections between its spelling and its sounds. If you can internalize that pattern and make it automatic, you'll save yourself a great deal of work.
  • The easiest way to internalize those patterns is to use your SRS. Create flash cards to memorize every spelling pattern you need.
  • In the process, approach foreign sounds and complex patterns from as many angles as you can-from their spellings to their sounds, even down to the individual mouth positions used for each sound. You're taking advantage of one of the stranger quirks of learning: the more bits and pieces you learn, the less work it takes to learn them. (Page 77)

#### Do THIS NOW: LEARN YOUR LANGUAGE'S SOUND SYSTEM
### CHAPTER 4 Word Play and the Symphony of a Word
- With only a thousand words, you'll recognize nearly 75 percent of what you read. With two thousand, you'll hit 80 percent. As you might expect, you'll run into diminishing returns after a while, but these frequency lists provide an incredible foundation for your language. (Page 87)
- The most frequent words aren't the same in every language: you won't need Republican to learn Russian, and collective Soviet farming community doesn't show up in Spanish very often. Each language has its own frequency list (the best frequency dictionaries are published by Routledge), and they are fascinating, both because of the words they include and the words they don't. (Page 88)
#### GAMES WITH WORDS
- So take a moment to have fun: it's much more efficient.
  To create a deep, multisensory memory for a word, you'll need to combine several ingredients: spelling, sound, meaning, and personal connection. (Page 90)
- When you research a word using Google Images, you're playing the Spot the Differences game; you're looking for the difference between what you expect to see, and you actually see. The internet is a lot of fun: the Internet is full of weird, funny pictures in all sorts of languages. (Page 92)
- • You can make your words more 'memorable in two ways:
  • By investigating the stories they tell 
  • By connecting those stories to your own life 
  • When you create flash cards, use the best storytelling tool ever invented: Google Images.
  • Then spend a moment to find a link between each word and your own experiences. (Page 93)
