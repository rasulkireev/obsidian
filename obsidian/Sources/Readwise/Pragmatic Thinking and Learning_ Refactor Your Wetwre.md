## Highlights
### Chapter 1 Introduction
- Software isn’t designed in an IDE or other tool. It’s imagined and created in our heads (Page 15)
#### 1.1 Again with the “Pragmatic”?
- As you grow and adapt, you may need to modify your habits and approaches as well. Nothing in life is ever static; only dead fsh go with the fow (Page 18)
#### 1.2 Consider the Context
- TIP 1 Always consider the context. (Page 19)

#### 1.4 Where We’re Going
##### The Dreyfus model of skill acquisition provides a powerful way of looking at how you move beyond beginner-level performance and begin the journey to mastery of a skill

- Acknowledgments Very special thanks to Ellie Hunt for introducing me to the Dreyfus model and related nursing research, suffering through my disjointed and rambling prose, keeping me on track, and keeping our domestic enterprises running like a well-oiled machine. A regular editor’s job is often diffcult and thankless, and mere appreciation in a preface really doesn’t do it justice. To be editor, mom, and business manager all at once truly takes skill and patience. Thanks to my friends on the Pragmatic Wetware mailing list and reviewers, including Bert Bates, Don Gray, Ron Green, Shawn Hartstock, Dierk Koenig, Niclas Nilsson, Paul Oakes, Jared Richardson, Linda Rising, Johanna Rothman, Jeremy Sydik, Steph Thompson, Derek Wade, and everyone else who posted their thoughts, experiences, and readings. Their combined experiences are invaluable. Special thanks to June Kim for his many contributions throughout the book, including pointers to far-fung research and stories of his own experiences, as well as his feedback throughout the stages of birthing this book. Special thanks also to Dr. Patricia Benner, who introduced the Dreyfus model of skills acquisition to the nursing profession, for her support and permission to quote from her works and for her enthusiasm for learning. Thanks go to Dr. Betty Edwards, who pioneered the practical applications of lateral specialization in the brain, for her kind support and permission to quote from her works.

### Chapter 2 Journey from Novice to Expert
#### Experts What do you call an expert software developer? A wizard. We work with magic numbers, things in hex, zombie processes, and mystical incantations such as tar -xzvf plugh.tgz and sudo gem install --includedependencies rails. We can even change our identity to become someone else or transform into the root user—the epitome of supreme power in the Unix world. Wizards make it look effortless. A dash of eye of newt, a little bat-wing dust, some incantations, and poof! The job is done.

#### Stages In the 1970s, the brothers Dreyfus (Hubert and Stuart) began doing their seminal research on how people attain and master skills. The Dreyfus brothers looked at highly skilled practitioners, including commercial Dreyfus is applicable airline pilots and world-renowned per skill. chess masters. 2 Their research showed that quite a bit changes as you move from novice to expert. You don’t just “know more” or gain skill.Instead, you experience fundamental differences in how you perceive the world, how you approach problem solving, and the mental models you form and use. How you go about acquiring new skills changes. External factors that help your performance—or hinder it—change as well.2.

- 2.2 The Five Dreyfus Model Stages (Page 30)
##### Stage 1: Novices
##### Stage 2: Advanced Beginners
##### Stage 3: Competent
##### Stage 4: Profcient
- Statistically, there aren’t very many experts—probably something on the order of 1 to 5 percent of the population (Page 37)
##### Stage 5: Expert
#### 2.3 Dreyfus at Work: Herding Racehorses and Racing Sheep
- Charles Darwin pegged it when he said, “Ignorance more frequently begets confdence than does knowledge. (Page 39)
- The converse seems to be true as well; once you truly become an expert, you become painfully aware of just how little you really know. (Page 39)
- When you are not very skilled in some area, you are more likely to think you’re actually pretty expert at it. (Page 39)
- In one of the Dreyfus studies, the researchers did exactly that. They took Rules ruin experts. seasoned airline pilots and had them draw up a set of rules for the novices, representing their best practices. They did, and the novices were able to improve their performance based on those rules. But then they made the experts follow their own rules. It degraded their measured performance signifcantly (Page 40)
- Conversely, we also tend to take novices and throw them in the deep end of the development pool—far over their heads. You might say we’re trying to race sheep, in this case.Again, it’s not an effective way to use novices. They need to be “herded,” that is, given unambiguous direction, quick successes, and so on. Agile development is a very effective tool, but it won’t work on a team composed solely of novices and advanced beginners. (Page 40)

- Most people are advanced beginners (Page 42)
- Also, metacognitive abilities, or the ability of being self-aware, tends to be possible only at the higher skill levels. Unfortunately, this means practitioners at the lower skill levels have a marked tendency to overestimate their own abilities—by as much as 50 percent, as it turns out. According to a study in Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Diffculties in Recognizing One’s Own Incompetence Lead to Infated Self-Assessments [KD99], the only path to a more correct self-assessment is to improve the individual’s skill level, which in turn increases metacognitive ability. You may see this referred to as second-order incompetence, not knowing just how much it is that you don’t know. The beginner is confdent despite the odds; the expert will be far more cautious when the going gets weird. Experts will show much more self-doubt (Page 43)

#### Teaching is an expertise in its own right
- 2.4 Using the Dreyfus Model Effectively (Page 44)
- Deliberate practice, according to noted cognitive scientist Dr. K. Anderson Ericsson, requires four conditions: • You need a well-defned task. • The task needs to be appropriately diffcult—challenging but doable. • The environment needs to supply informative feedback that you can act on. • It should also provide opportunities for repetition and correction of errors (Page 45)

- Peripheral vision is much more sensitive to light than your central vision. That’s why if you see isn’t something faint out of the corner of your eye (such as a ship on the horizon or a star), it can disappear if you look at it head-on. (Page 63)
- CAPTURE INSIGHT 24X7 63 Who’s in Charge Here? You might think that the narrative voice in your head is in control and that the voice is your consciousness, or the real “you.” It is not. In fact, by the time the words are formed in your head, the thought behind them is very old. Some considerable time later those words might actually be formed by your mouth. Not only is there a time delay from the original thought to your awareness of it, but there is no central locus of thought in the brain. Thoughts rise up and compete in clouds, and the winner at any point in time is your consciousness. We’ll look at this in more depth in Section 8.2, Defocus to Focus, on page 225. able but very simple technique to deal with the fact that R-mode is asynchronous. 3.2 Capture Insight 24x7 (Page 64)

##### Characteristics Of course, there are quite a few differences between R-mode and L-mode beyond R-mode’s unpredictability. If you’ve ever said, “I’m of two minds about that,” you were probably more literally correct than you thought at the time. You actually have a number of different processing modes in the brain. Each one has unique characteristics that can help you just when you need it most. The fastest processing modes are the muscle-memory sorts of responses that don’t even travel up to the cortex itself.8 Piano players don’t think about each and every note and chord in a fast passage; there isn’t time. Instead, the muscles involved more or less just tackle the problem on their own without much conscious involvement or direction. Similarly, that instinctive slam on the brakes or quick dodge on the bicycle doesn’t involve any CPU processing—it’s all in the peripherals. Since lightning-fast typing and similar physical skills aren’t of too much interest to us as programmers, I’m not going to talk too much about these non-CPU modes and responses. 8. The cortex, which comes from the Latin word for tree bark, is the outer layer of folded gray matter and is key to conscious thinking.

- just because a thought process is nonrational or nonrepeatable doesn’t mean it is unscientifc, irresponsible, or inappropriate in any way. (Page 75)

- Why Emphasize R-mode (Page 75)
- We want to use R-mode more than we have because the R-mode provides intuition, and that’s something we desperately need in order to become experts. We cannot be expert without it. The Dreyfus model emphasizes the expert’s reliance on tacit knowledge; that’s over here in the R-mode as well. Experts rely on seeing and discriminating patterns; pattern matching is here too.R-mode’s analogic and holistic thinking styles are very valuable (Page 75)

- In fact, synthesis is such a powerful learning technique that Nicholas Negroponte of the MIT Media Lab suggested in Don’t Dissect the Frog, Build It [Neg94] that to really learn about a frog, traditional dissection is not the way to go. The better way to learn about a frog is to build one. (Page 75)
##### TIP 9 Learn by synthesis as well as by analysis
- 3.4 Rise of the R-mode (Page 76)
- To progress, in order to move on to the next revolution in human development, we need to learn to reintegrate our largely neglected R-mode processing with L-mode (Page 76)

- That’s an important point: the iPod says how many songs it holds. The Microsoft-favored parody (and many real competing devices) say how many It’s about the songs, not gigabytes it will hold. Consumers don’t gigabytes. care about gigabytes; only we geeks do. Real people want to know how many songs it will hold or how many photos or videos. 12 (Page 78)

- In fact, additional studies16 have shown exactly that: positive emotions are essential to learning and creative thinking. Being “happy” broadens your thought processes and brings more of the brain’s hardware online. (Page 79)

- If you’re a programmer stuck in a drab cubicle, you will never grow new neurons. On the other hand, in a rich environment with things to learn, observe, and interact with, you will grow plenty of new neurons and new connections between them. (Page 80)
##### TIP 10 Strive for good design; it really works better
- Creativity comes from the selection and assembly of just the right components in just the right presentation to create the work. And selection—knowing what to select and in what context—comes from pattern matching, and that’s a topic to which we’ll keep returning (Page 81)
- One of the foremost building architects of the twentieth century, Louis Kahn, offers a useful explanation of the relationship between beauty and design: “Design is not making beauty; beauty emerges from selection, affnities, integration, love. ” Beauty emerges from selection. Kahn explains that beauty emerges from selection. That is, art comes not so much from the act of creation itself but rather from selecting among a near infnite supply of choices. (Page 81)

##### 3.7 How Do You Get There?
- Chapter 4 Get in Your Right Mind (Page 86)
    - Note: Step out of your comfort zone.
- A man should learn to detect and foster that gleam of light which fashes across his mind from within far more than the lustre of the whole frmament without. Yet he dismisses without notice his peculiar thought because it is peculiar. Ralph Waldo Emerson Chapter 4 Get in Your Right Mind In this chapter, we’ll look at a whole bunch of techniques to help bring more mental processing power online for you. Some may be familiar to you, and others will defnitely be more exotic; don’t shy away from the “odd” ones. If you are repelled and don’t want to try something, that’s probably exactly what you should try frst. Emerson points out in the opening epigraph that we tend to dismiss unusual or uncomfortable thoughts—and that’s a bad thing. You might miss out on that million-dollar idea of a lifetime. Instead, you need to pay attention to all that your mind has to offer. Sure, some of what you fnd will be the intellectual equivalent of a Gilligan’s Island rerun, but you may also fnd that one idea that makes all the difference in the world. So, we’re going to look at it all, be it good, bad, or ugly. You probably know what L-mode processing feels like; it’s that little voice in your head that makes L-mode very noticeable. But what does R-mode feel like? You’ll do an exercise that will let you experience a cognitive shift to R-mode, and we’ll see different ways to help engage more R-mode processing. We’ll also look at ways of integrating L-mode and R-mode more effectively, and I’ll show you a variety of techniques to help harvest the fruits of your R-mode’s hidden labor. 4.1 Turn Up the Sensory Input (Page 86)

#### change your environment regularly, and feed your brain. Any sort of extrasensory involvement is probably helpful, whether it’s a long walk though crunchy leaves with your dog, opening your window and listening to the day’s weather (and actually smelling some fresh air!), or just walking to the break room or down to the gym (the air there is less fresh, but exercise is also very helpful for better brain function)
- Side I’ve claimed a number of times that we’re not using our R-mode facilities as well as we might.Well, we’re going to do a little experiment now to prove that and see how to deliberately get into a pure R-mode cognitive state. I’ve given many talks across the United States and Europe based on the material that became this book. One of my favorite bits from the talks is a simple survey question I ask the audience: tell me how well you can draw. The results are always the same. In a crowd of 100 technical types (programmers, testers, and managers), maybe one or two folks claim to be able to draw very well. Maybe another fve to eight or so claim somewhat competent drawing skills but nothing suitable for framing.
