## Highlights
- So… the next time you’re writing something that you hope will motivate somebody to take a specific action, start by grabbing their attention.
  Then, give them a reason to read on.
  Then, trigger an emotional response.
  Finally, lead them to an action that will gratify that emotion
- Basically, great copy follows the “AIDA” formula:
  Attention: Start by saying something that will snap the reader into paying attention.
  Interest: Next, peak the reader’s curiosity and give them a reason to read on.
  Desire: Create an emotional response in the reader that will prime them to take an action.
  Action: Lead the reader into taking a specific next step.
