## Highlights
- Steve Jobs said it better than anyone:
  "In most people's vocabularies, design is a veneer. It's interior decorating. It's fabric of the curtains of the sofa. But to me, nothing could be further from the meaning of design. Design is the fundamental soul of a human-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product."
  Read that last sentence again, because it's really important. You have to see those "successive layers" to really understand where good design comes from.
