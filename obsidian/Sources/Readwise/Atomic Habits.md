# Atomic Habits
![Atomic Habits-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/default-book-icon-8.18caceaece2b.png)

## Metadata
- Author: [[James Clear]]

## Highlights
- I built good sleep habits and went to bed early each night. In the messy world of a college dorm, I made a point to keep my room neat and tidy. These improvements were minor, but they gave me a sense of control over my life. I started to feel confident again. (Location 121)
    - Note: Thts the point . Feel in control of your life.
- ...changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years. (Location 136)

### THE FUNDAMENTALS Why Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference
#### 1 The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits
##### WHY SMALL HABITS MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE
- 1% BETTER EVERY DAY 1% worse every day for one year. 0.99365 = 00.03 1% better every day for one year. 1.01365 = 37.78 (Location 230)
##### YOUR HABITS CAN COMPOUND FOR YOU OR AGAINST YOU
##### WHAT PROGRESS IS REALLY LIKE
- habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold (Location 295)
- This is one of the core reasons why it is so hard to build habits that last. People make a few small changes, fail to see a tangible result, and decide to stop. (Location 299)
##### THE PLATEAU OF LATENT POTENTIAL
- We often expect progress to be linear. At the very least, we hope it will come quickly. In reality, the results of our efforts are often delayed. It is not until months or years later that we realize the true value of the previous work we have done. (Location 316)

- All big things come from small beginnings. (Location 320)

##### FORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD
- Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals. Goal setting suffers from a serious case of survivorship bias. (Location 346)
- Achieving a goal is only a momentary change. (Location 353)
- Goals restrict your happiness. The implicit assumption behind any goal is this: “Once I reach my goal, then I’ll be happy.” (Location 361)
##### A SYSTEM OF ATOMIC HABITS
- Focusing on the overall system, rather than a single goal, is one of the core themes of this book. (Location 380)
#### 2 How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)
- Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way. (Location 405)
##### THREE LAYERS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE
- The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. (Location 452)
    - Note: Im not a smoker
- True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity. (Location 458)
- On any given day, you may struggle with your habits because you’re too busy or too tired or too overwhelmed or hundreds of other reasons. Over the long run, however, the real reason you fail to stick with habits is that your self-image gets in the way. This is why you can’t get too attached to one version of your identity. Progress requires unlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity. (Location 486)
##### THE TWO-STEP PROCESS TO CHANGING YOUR IDENTITY
- Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. (Location 514)
    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
- New identities require new evidence. If you keep casting the same votes you’ve always cast, you’re going to get the same results you’ve always had. If nothing changes, nothing is going to change. It is a simple two-step process: Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins. (Location 528)
##### THE REAL REASON HABITS MATTER
- “Are you becoming the type of person you want to become?” The first step is not what or how, but who. You need to know who you want to be. Otherwise, your quest for change is like a boat without a rudder. (Location 553)
#### 3 How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps
##### WHY YOUR BRAIN BUILDS HABITS
##### THE SCIENCE OF HOW HABITS WORK
##### THE HABIT LOOP
- In summary, the cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately, becomes associated with the cue. Together, these four steps form a neurological feedback loop—cue, craving, response, reward; cue, craving, response, reward—that ultimately allows you to create automatic habits. This cycle is known as the habit loop. (Location 667)
- 1. Cue: You hit a stumbling block on a project at work.
  2. Craving: You feel stuck and want to relieve your frustration. Solution phase
  3. Response: You pull out your phone and check social media.
  4. Reward: You satisfy your craving to feel relieved. Checking social media becomes associated with feeling stalled at work. (Location 713)
    - Note: This one hits through the heart .
##### THE FOUR LAWS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE
- The 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious. The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive. The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy. The 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying. (Location 735)
- Inversion of the 1st law (Cue): Make it invisible. Inversion of the 2nd law (Craving): Make it unattractive. Inversion of the 3rd law (Response): Make it difficult. Inversion of the 4th law (Reward): Make it unsatisfying. (Location 741)
- Whenever you want to change your behavior, you can simply ask yourself: How can I make it obvious? How can I make it attractive? How can I make it easy? How can I make it satisfying? (Location 748)
### THE 1ST LAW Make It Obvious
#### 4 The Man Who Didn’t Look Right
##### THE HABITS SCORECARD
#### 5 The Best Way to Start a New Habit
- Hundreds of studies have shown that implementation intentions are effective for sticking to our goals, whether it’s writing down the exact time and date of when you will get a flu shot or recording the time of your colonoscopy appointment. They increase the odds that people will stick with habits like recycling, studying, going to sleep early, and stopping smoking. (Location 907)
##### HABIT STACKING: A SIMPLE PLAN TO OVERHAUL YOUR HABITS
- When it comes to building new habits, you can use the connectedness of behavior to your advantage. One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking. (Location 958)

##### HABIT STACKING
#### 6 Motivation Is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More
- People often choose products not because of what they are, but because of where they are. (Location 1058)
##### HOW TO DESIGN YOUR ENVIRONMENT FOR SUCCESS
- When the cues that spark a habit are subtle or hidden, they are easy to ignore. (Location 1099)
- THE CONTEXT IS THE CUE (Location 1123)
- Our behavior is not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them. In fact, this is a useful way to think about the influence of the environment on your behavior. Stop thinking about your environment as filled with objects. Start thinking about it as filled with relationships. (Location 1129)

- The mantra I find useful is “One space, one use.” (Location 1149)

    - Note: In regards to attaching habits to specific locations.
#### 7 The Secret to Self-Control
- Habit stacking works best when the cue is highly specific and immediately actionable. Many people select cues that are too vague. I made this mistake myself. When I wanted to start a push-up habit, my habit stack was “When I take a break for lunch, I will do ten push-ups.” At first glance, this sounded reasonable. But soon, I realized the trigger was unclear. Would I do my push-ups before I ate lunch? After I ate lunch? Where would I do them? After a few inconsistent days, I changed my habit stack to: “When I close my laptop for lunch, I will do ten push-ups next to my desk.” Ambiguity gone. (Location 1190)
- The idea that a little bit of discipline would solve all our problems is deeply embedded in our culture. Recent research, however, shows something different. When scientists analyze people who appear to have tremendous self-control, it turns out those individuals aren’t all that different from those who are struggling. Instead, “disciplined” people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control. In other words, they spend less time in tempting situations. (Location 1197)
    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
- The people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it the least. It’s easier to practice self-restraint when you don’t have to use it very often. So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment. (Location 1201)
    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
- If you’re not careful about cues, you can cause the very behavior you want to stop. (Location 1212)
    - Note: So many things people do to avoid certain behaviour, lead to that behavior.
- This is the secret to self-control. Make the cues of your good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible. (Location 1238)
### THE 2ND LAW Make It Attractive
#### 8 How to Make a Habit Irresistible
- Entire departments are dedicated to optimizing how a product feels in your mouth—a quality known as orosensation. (Location 1306)
- If history serves as a guide, the opportunities of the future will be more attractive than those of today. The trend is for rewards to become more concentrated and stimuli to become more enticing. Junk food is a more concentrated form of calories than natural foods. Hard liquor is a more concentrated form of alcohol than beer. Video games are a more concentrated form of play than board games. Compared to nature, these pleasure-packed experiences are hard to resist. We have the brains of our ancestors but temptations they never had to face. (Location 1323)
##### THE DOPAMINE-DRIVEN FEEDBACK LOOP
- The importance of dopamine became apparent in 1954 when the neuroscientists James Olds and Peter Milner ran an experiment that revealed the neurological processes behind craving and desire. By implanting electrodes in the brains of rats, the researchers blocked the release of dopamine. To the surprise of the scientists, the rats lost all will to live. They wouldn’t eat. They wouldn’t have sex. They didn’t crave anything. Within a few days, the animals died of thirst. In follow-up studies, other scientists also inhibited the dopamine-releasing parts of the brain, but this time, they squirted little droplets of sugar into the mouths of the dopamine-depleted rats. Their little rat faces lit up with pleasurable grins from the tasty substance. Even though dopamine was blocked, they liked the sugar just as much as before; they just didn’t want it anymore. The ability to experience pleasure remained, but without dopamine, desire died. And without desire, action stopped. When other researchers reversed this process and flooded the reward system of the brain with dopamine, animals performed habits at breakneck speed. In one study, mice received a powerful hit of dopamine each time they poked their nose in a box. Within minutes, the mice developed a craving so strong they began poking their nose into the box eight hundred times per hour. (Location 1332)
    - Note: What a fascinating study
- When it comes to habits, the key takeaway is this: dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it. (Location 1347)
##### THE DOPAMINE SPIKE
##### HOW TO USE TEMPTATION BUNDLING TO MAKE YOUR HABITS MORE ATTRACTIVE
- Temptation bundling is one way to apply a psychology theory known as Premack’s Principle. Named after the work of professor David Premack, the principle states that “more probable behaviors will reinforce less probable behaviors.” In other words, even if you don’t really want to process overdue work emails, you’ll become conditioned to do it if it means you get to do something you really want to do along the way. (Location 1395)
#### 9 The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits
##### THE SEDUCTIVE PULL OF SOCIAL NORMS
- We imitate the habits of three groups in particular: The close. The many. The powerful. (Location 1464)
    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
- One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior. New habits seem achievable when you see others doing them every day. (Location 1483)
- To make your habits even more attractive, you can take this strategy one step further. Join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group. (Location 1487)
- The shared identity begins to reinforce your personal identity. This is why remaining part of a group after achieving a goal is crucial to maintaining your habits. It’s friendship and community that embed a new identity and help behaviors last over the long run. (Location 1496)
##### CONFORMING TO SOCIAL NORMS
- Whenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the group to guide our behavior. We are constantly scanning our environment and wondering, “What is everyone else doing?” We check reviews on Amazon or Yelp or TripAdvisor because we want to imitate the “best” buying, eating, and travel habits. (Location 1519)
- The human mind knows how to get along with others. It wants to get along with others. This is our natural mode. You can override it—you can choose to ignore the group or to stop caring what other people think—but it takes work. Running against the grain of your culture requires extra effort. (Location 1527)
- When changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is unattractive. When changing your habits means fitting in with the tribe, change is very attractive. (Location 1529)
#### 10 How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits
##### WHERE CRAVINGS COME FROM
- A craving is the sense that something is missing. It is the desire to change your internal state. (Location 1625)
- Desire is the difference between where you are now and where you want to be in the future. (Location 1627)
##### HOW TO REPROGRAM YOUR BRAIN TO ENJOY HARD HABITS
### THE 3RD LAW Make It Easy
#### 11 Walk Slowly, but Never Backward
- It is easy to get bogged down trying to find the optimal plan for change: the fastest way to lose weight, the best program to build muscle, the perfect idea for a side hustle. We are so focused on figuring out the best approach that we never get around to taking action. As Voltaire once wrote, “The best is the enemy of the good.” (Location 1727)
- If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection. You don’t need to map out every feature of a new habit. You just need to practice it. This is the first takeaway of the 3rd Law: you just need to get your reps in. (Location 1744)
##### HOW LONG DOES IT ACTUALLY TAKE TO FORM A NEW HABIT?
#### 12 The Law of Least Effort
##### THE SHAPE OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR
- And the less energy a habit requires, the more likely it is to occur. (Location 1829)
- In a sense, every habit is just an obstacle to getting what you really want. Dieting is an obstacle to getting fit. Meditation is an obstacle to feeling calm. Journaling is an obstacle to thinking clearly. You don’t actually want the habit itself. What you really want is the outcome the habit delivers. (Location 1832)
    - Note: It makes a big difference if you know why you are building a habit, for what.
##### HOW TO ACHIEVE MORE WITH LESS EFFORT
- I like to refer to this strategy as addition by subtraction.* The Japanese companies looked for every point of friction in the manufacturing process and eliminated it. As they subtracted wasted effort, they added customers and revenue. (Location 1863)
- when we remove the points of friction that sap our time and energy, we can achieve more with less effort. (This is one reason tidying up can feel so good: we are simultaneously moving forward and lightening the cognitive load our environment places on us.) (Location 1865)
- When the first voice-activated speakers were released—products like Google Home, Amazon Echo, and Apple HomePod—I asked a friend what he liked about the product he had purchased. He said it was just easier to say “Play some country music” than to pull out his phone, open the music app, and pick a playlist. Of course, just a few years earlier, having unlimited access to music in your pocket was a remarkably frictionless behavior compared to driving to the store and buying a CD. Business is a never-ending quest to deliver the same result in an easier fashion. (Location 1873)
    - Note: Future is about making products with less friction. Who succeedds, wins. It's easy to imagines that there is an end with this process, but i think that this is actually a never ending process.
##### PRIME THE ENVIRONMENT FOR FUTURE USE
- It is remarkable how little friction is required to prevent unwanted behavior. (Location 1913)
- Whether we are approaching behavior change as an individual, a parent, a coach, or a leader, we should ask ourselves the same question: “How can we design a world where it’s easy to do what’s right?” Redesign your life so the actions that matter most are also the actions that are easiest to do. (Location 1917)
#### 13 How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule
- Every day, there are a handful of moments that deliver an outsized impact. I refer to these little choices as decisive moments. The moment you decide between ordering takeout or cooking dinner. The moment you choose between driving your car or riding your bike. The moment you decide between starting your homework or grabbing the video game controller. These choices are a fork in the road. (Location 1949)
##### DECISIVE MOMENTS
- We are limited by where our habits lead us. This is why mastering the decisive moments throughout your day is so important. Each day is made up of many moments, but it is really a few habitual choices that determine the path you take. These little choices stack up, each one setting the trajectory for how you spend the next chunk of time. Habits are the entry point, not the end point. They are the cab, not the gym. (Location 1959)
    - Note: Making just one good decision can go a long way to make a good day
- Each (Location 1960)
##### THE TWO-MINUTE RULE
- “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.” (Location 1965)
    - Note: Make it easy
- once you’ve started doing the right thing, it is much easier to continue doing it. (Location 1973)
- The point is to master the habit of showing up. The truth is, a habit must be established before it can be improved. (Location 1997)
- As Voltaire once wrote, “The best is the enemy of the good. (Location 2002)
#### 14 How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible
- Sometimes success is less about making good habits easy and more about making bad habits hard. (Location 2070)
- make your bad habits more difficult by creating what psychologists call a commitment device. A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that controls your actions in the future. It is a way to lock in future behavior, bind you to good habits, and restrict you from bad ones. (Location 2072)
##### HOW TO AUTOMATE A HABIT AND NEVER THINK ABOUT IT AGAIN
- The best way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical to do. Increase the friction until you don’t even have the option to act. (Location 2102)
##### ONETIME ACTIONS THAT LOCK IN GOOD HABITS
- they involve putting technology to work for you. Technology can transform actions that were once hard, annoying, and complicated into behaviors that are easy, painless, and simple. It is the most reliable and effective way to guarantee the right behavior. (Location 2132)
    - Note: The most powerful aNd versatile way tech caN help you is through remiknders. However, there are a ton of different way to ajtomate nd mAke your life easier.
- As mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead wrote, “Civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them.” (Location 2143)
- Technology creates a level of convenience that enables you to act on your smallest whims and desires. (Location 2147)
### THE 4TH LAW Make It Satisfying
#### 15 The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change
- “It is a lot easier for people to adopt a product that provides a strong positive sensory signal, for example the mint taste of toothpaste, than it is to adopt a habit that does not provide pleasurable sensory feedback, like flossing one’s teeth. (Location 2231)
- We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. (Location 2240)
##### THE MISMATCH BETWEEN IMMEDIATE AND DELAYED REWARDS
- The human brain did not evolve for life in a delayed-return environment. The earliest remains of modern humans, known as Homo sapiens sapiens, are approximately two hundred thousand years old. These were the first humans to have a brain relatively similar to ours. In particular, the neocortex—the newest part of the brain and the region responsible for higher functions like language—was roughly the same size two hundred thousand years ago as today. You are walking around with the same hardware as your Paleolithic ancestors. (Location 2268)
    - Note: When people say , leople used to do this or that before, as an argument for why what we xo now is fine, for esxample eatimg bread. The reality is that we need to comlare ourself with early homo sapie s as this where the most of evolujtfiom happened.
- Put another way, the costs of your good habits are in the present. The costs of your bad habits are in the future. (Location 2291)
    - Note: This is somewhat related to the Second Order effect talkmed by Ray Dalio
##### HOW TO TURN INSTANT GRATIFICATION TO YOUR ADVANTAGE
- In summary, a habit needs to be enjoyable for it to last. Simple bits of reinforcement—like soap that smells great or toothpaste that has a refreshing mint flavor or seeing $50 hit your savings account—can offer the immediate pleasure you need to enjoy a habit. And change is easy when it is enjoyable. (Location 2343)
#### 16 How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day
- A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit. (Location 2371)
- Benefit #1: Habit tracking is obvious. (Location 2383)
    - Tags: [[h4]] 
- The mere act of tracking a behavior can spark the urge to change it. (Location 2388)
- Benefit #2: Habit tracking is attractive. (Location 2392)
    - Tags: [[h4]] 
- Benefit #3: Habit tracking is satisfying. (Location 2397)
    - Tags: [[h4]] 
- Finally, record each measurement immediately after the habit occurs. The completion of the behavior is the cue to write it down. (Location 2420)
##### HOW TO RECOVER QUICKLY WHEN YOUR HABITS BREAK DOWN
- The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit. (Location 2436)
- Anyone can have a bad performance, a bad workout, or a bad day at work. But when successful people fail, they rebound quickly. The breaking of a habit doesn’t matter if the reclaiming of it is fast. (Location 2438)
##### KNOWING WHEN (AND WHEN NOT) TO TRACK A HABIT
- When we choose the wrong measurement, we get the wrong behavior. (Location 2464)
- Goodhart’s Law. Named after the economist Charles Goodhart, the principle states, “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” Measurement is only useful when it guides you and adds context to a larger picture, not when it consumes you. (Location 2465)
- In our data-driven world, we tend to overvalue numbers and undervalue anything ephemeral, soft, and difficult to quantify. We mistakenly think the factors we can measure are the only factors that exist. But just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing. And just because you can’t measure something doesn’t mean it’s not important at all. (Location 2467)
#### 17 How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything
- Just as we are more likely to repeat an experience when the ending is satisfying, we are also more likely to avoid an experience when the ending is painful. Pain is an effective teacher. If a failure is painful, it gets fixed. If a failure is relatively painless, it gets ignored. The more immediate and more costly a mistake is, the faster you will learn from it. (Location 2502)
- We repeat bad habits because they serve us in some way, and that makes them hard to abandon. The best way I know to overcome this predicament is to increase the speed of the punishment associated with the behavior. (Location 2508)
##### THE HABIT CONTRACT
- Knowing that someone is watching can be a powerful motivator. (Location 2554)
### ADVANCED TACTICS How to Go from Being Merely Good to Being Truly Great
#### 18 The Truth About Talent (When Genes Matter and When They Don’t)
- The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition. This is just as true with habit change as it is with sports and business. (Location 2633)
- Habits are easier to perform, and more satisfying to stick with, when they align with your natural inclinations and abilities. (Location 2634)
- The key is to direct your effort toward areas that both excite you and match your natural skills, to align your ambition with your ability. (Location 2649)
- HOW YOUR PERSONALITY INFLUENCES YOUR HABITS (Location 2652)
- The most proven scientific analysis of personality traits is known as the “Big Five,” (Location 2660)
- All five characteristics have biological underpinnings. Extroversion, for instance, can be tracked from birth. If scientists play a loud noise in the nursing ward, some babies turn toward it while others turn away. When the researchers tracked these children through life, they found that the babies who turned toward the noise were more likely to grow up to be extroverts. Those who turned away were more likely to become introverts. (Location 2667)
- HOW TO FIND A GAME WHERE THE ODDS ARE IN YOUR FAVOR (Location 2689)
- What feels like fun to me, but work to others? (Location 2714)
- What makes me lose track of time? (Location 2716)
- Where do I get greater returns than the average person? (Location 2719)
- What comes naturally to me? (Location 2723)
- When you can’t win by being better, you can win by being different. By combining your skills, you reduce the level of competition, which makes it easier to stand out. (Location 2734)
##### HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR GENES
- In summary, one of the best ways to ensure your habits remain satisfying over the long-run is to pick behaviors that align with your personality and skills. Work hard on the things that come easy. (Location 2756)
#### 19 The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work
- The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right. (Location 2797)
- Once a habit has been established, however, it’s important to continue to advance in small ways. These little improvements and new challenges keep you engaged. And if you hit the Goldilocks Zone just right, you can achieve a flow state. (Location 2806)
- A flow state is the experience of being “in the zone” and fully immersed in an activity. Scientists have tried to quantify this feeling. They found that to achieve a state of flow, a task must be roughly 4 percent beyond your current ability. (Location 2808)
##### HOW TO STAY FOCUSED WHEN YOU GET BORED WORKING ON YOUR GOALS
- successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom. (Location 2824)
- The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. We get bored with habits because they stop delighting us. The outcome becomes expected. And as our habits become ordinary, we start derailing our progress to seek novelty. Perhaps this is why we get caught up in a never-ending cycle, jumping from one workout to the next, one diet to the next, one business idea to the next. As soon as we experience the slightest dip in motivation, we begin seeking a new strategy—even if the old one was still working. (Location 2829)
- Machiavelli noted, “Men desire novelty to such an extent that those who are doing well wish for a change as much as those who are doing badly.” (Location 2832)
    - Tags: [[quote]] 
- I can guarantee that if you manage to start a habit and keep sticking to it, there will be days when you feel like quitting. When you start a business, there will be days when you don’t feel like showing up. When you’re at the gym, there will be sets that you don’t feel like finishing. When it’s time to write, there will be days that you don’t feel like typing. But stepping up when it’s annoying or painful or draining to do so, that’s what makes the difference between a professional and an amateur. (Location 2850)
- The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom. (Location 2862)
#### 20 The Downside of Creating Good Habits
- Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery (Location 2888)
- Mastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a tiny element of success, repeating it until you have internalized the skill, and then using this new habit as the foundation to advance to the next frontier of your development. (Location 2892)
##### MASTERING ONE HABIT
- The process of mastery requires that you progressively layer improvements on top of one another, each habit building upon the last until a new level of performance has been reached and a higher range of skills has been internalized. (Location 2898)
##### HOW TO REVIEW YOUR HABITS AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS
##### HOW TO BREAK THE BELIEFS THAT HOLD YOU BACK
- Men are born soft and supple; dead, they are stiff and hard. Plants are born tender and pliant; dead, they are brittle and dry. Thus whoever is stiff and inflexible is a disciple of death. Whoever is soft and yielding is a disciple of life. The hard and stiff will be broken. The soft and supple will prevail. —LAO TZU (Location 3000)

#### Conclusion The Secret to Results That Last
- Success is not a goal to reach or a finish line to cross. It is a system to improve, an endless process to refine. (Location 3033)
    - Tags: [[success]] 
- Sometimes a habit will be hard to remember and you’ll need to make it obvious. Other times you won’t feel like starting and you’ll need to make it attractive. In many cases, you may find that a habit will be too difficult and you’ll need to make it easy. And sometimes, you won’t feel like sticking with it and you’ll need to make it satisfying. (Location 3037)
- The secret to getting results that last is to never stop making improvements. It’s remarkable what you can build if you just don’t stop. (Location 3052)

#### What Should You Read Next?
