## Highlights
- Justin Kan, Twitch’s cofounder, just wants his favorite chess streamers to notice him. “I’m in the chat, like, giving them donations, hoping they say my name and shit,” he tells WIRED. He’s terrible at chess, but he can’t stop watching Andrea and Alexandra Botez play it on Twitch. They haven’t acknowledged him yet. He hopes they will soon.
    - Note: Wow, did not realize that the popularity of chess is that wide spread.
- In 2012, Twitch hosted 2,200 average concurrent livestreams to 102,000 average concurrent viewers—or, to put it another way, that’s 46 times as many concurrent viewers as channels. Since then, that ratio has shrunk to 25 times as many viewers as live channels in 2021. (Recently, Twitch watchdog Zach Bussey pointed out that, in the spring of 2021, if a streamer attracted more than six viewers they were in the top 6.7 percent of Twitch streamers.)
    - Note: That's a big decrease. I wonder what is the cause:
      - more livestreams (perhaps)
      - less viewers (unlikely)
      - viewers are converting to streamers (probably not so much)
      Having 6 viewers sounds simple, but it puts you in top 6.7%, that's crazy.
- But by 2017 it had become apparent that “making it” on Twitch required more than a 9-to-5 commitment. Streamers had to be on all the time to grind out followers across game genres, across time zones. With no division between work and play, free time and work time, online and offline, streamers’ precious free moments became defined by missed opportunities (something many freelancers can probably relate to). In 2018, when the Fortnite boom really catapulted Twitch into the mainstream, Ninja figured that in the hour he spent talking to The New York Times about burnout, he lost 200 or 300 subscribers. When he went to E3, he said, he lost 100,000 subscribers, or $500,000. Even his six-day honeymoon, he says, was “a calculated risk.”
    - Note: That's tough. Never thought about it that way. It's probably a little different for programming streamers, as their audiience is less likely to always have free time )or similar reason that I can't identify right now.
- Fans felt, and still feel, entitled to streamers’ time and emotional labor—on Instagram, Discord, Twitter, Snapchat.
- “If you have 1,000 fans willing to support you, that can be a really meaningful way to build a career.”
    - Note: Twitch COO Sara Clemens says... Homage to one certain Kevin Kelly :)
