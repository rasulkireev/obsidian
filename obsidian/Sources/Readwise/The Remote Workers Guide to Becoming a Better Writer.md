## Highlights
- It’s no wonder “be a strong writer” is one of the first pieces of advice people give to those seeking remote work. 
- Use the simplest word available. This can be especially important on a global team where English is a second language for many. 
- Keep it casual. While there’s a place and time for formality, in most cases it’s best to use laid-back language
- Don’t use acronyms or jargon. Acronyms and jargon are so-called shortcuts that can actually take your teammates a longer time to understand.
- Keep it short.
- Recognize that you only have your teammates’ attention for so long. Dive right in without taking detours or rambling about the unrelated.
- Try a tl;dr. Most commonly a lazy person’s plea for summation online, a tl;dr (too long; didn’t read) can be repurposed for writing on remote teams. After writing a long post, add a short summary (1-2 sentences) at the start to condense your message and provide a preview of what’s to come.
- Be bold and provide concise suggestions on moving projects forward instead of letting them sit in limbo. 
- Find the balance of being gracious when making requests of colleagues while also being clear and explicit with what you need.
- be intentional about the modes of communication you choose
- Use active voice instead of passive voice. This is a literary device that makes writing interesting.
- Stick to one idea per paragraph
- Avoid negative assumptions. If you’re starting sentences to your colleagues with “You probably haven’t…” or “It’s likely you didn’t…”, you may be in dangerous territory.
