## Highlights
- I use the spaced-repetition app Anki for this. My cards are just positions drawn from computer analysis of my own games: I put blunders and mistakes from my games here (front side of the card is the position before my move, reverse shows the correct move.) I also put many positions from the openings that I play here.
    - Note: Good strategy. After each games use computer analysis to determine the worst moves (mistakes), and what move should have been done instead.
      This method is not ideal, though. One reason being is that once you improve you are much less likely to make the same mistakes. Receiving those mistakes in your Anki is then "a waste of time". However, this is a tiny time waste and is therefore not worth coming up with a better system.
