![A Few 80/20 Tips for Writing-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article4.6bc1851654a0.png)

## Metadata

## Highlights
- Determine what you want to say, then say it. Each paragraph must have a purpose.
- Write a rough draft, then rewrite it removing and simplifying everything you can.
- Leave your reader with just one new thought. If there are multiple topics you wish to discuss, write multiple articles.
- Make sure your content is actionable. If it’s not then it’s just your diary, or worse, a lame attempt at SEO.
- Share your strong opinions. Let your readers disagree if they wish, trying to please everyone with vague advice will neuter your article.
