## Highlights
- Being afraid of something doesn’t mean you have to stay afraid.
- Choose one project. One goal. One impossible thing.
  Find a date to start. Take your first cold shower. (The times you wuss out and back out don’t count. Start counting from the first time you get to five minutes.)
  Once you reach five minutes, start counting your showers.
  Take one five minute cold shower every morning for thirty days.
  Throw a ten minute shower in there just for fun.
  Finish your project. Do something impossible. Change your life.
