## Highlights
- But most blogs struggle to get over a few hundred visitors a day. And most companies that try blogging and content marketing as an acquisition strategy get nothing from it.
  In almost every case, it’s because they’re focusing on the wrong things. Quantity over quality. Link building over question answering. Design over writing. Popups over value.

- Principle 1: Create the Best Content Online
  The first principle of the strategy is that you should only write something if it’s going to be the best article on that topic on the Internet. Anything less than that is a waste of time. 
- As you’re writing your own content, take note of when you have to link out to external sources to explain something. If it’s related to your niche, that’s an article that you should write for your own site, and do a better job with. Over time, you can keep going back and updating links in your articles that were to external sites to be to your own explanations, and keep people within your ecosystem.

- you shouldn’t sacrifice article topics and quality just to go after high value keywords.
  Rather, you should have everything you want to write about, and then make sure that it’s as tailored for SEO as possible
- For health and anything science related, you should only be citing research articles. For marketing, only data or stories. For anything else, cite Wikipedia.
- These are the five principles to keep in mind as you go forward. Write the best content online. Don’t make readers leave. Be keyword informed but not driven. Get other people involved. And make sure you’re doing good sourcing
