## Metadata
- Author: [[Mortimer J. Adler;Charles Van Doren]]

## Highlights
- As Pascal observed three hundred years ago, “When we read too fast or too slowly, we understand nothing.” (Location 103)
### The Dimensions of Reading
#### The Activity and Art of Reading
- The viewer of television, the listener to radio, the reader of magazines, is presented with a whole complex of elements—all the way from ingenious rhetoric to carefully selected data and statistics—to make it easy for him to “make up his own mind” with the minimum of difficulty and effort. But the packaging is often done so effectively that the viewer, listener, or reader does not make up his own mind at all. Instead, he inserts a packaged opinion into his mind, somewhat like inserting a cassette into a cassette player. He then pushes a button and “plays back” the opinion whenever it seems appropriate to do so (Location 171)

      Fox comes to mind first.
- Here by “learning” is meant understanding more, not remembering more information that has the same degree of intelligibility as other information you already possess. (Location 242)
    - Note: Never thought about this distinction betwseen learning more and understanding more .
- We do not want to give the impression that facts, leading to increased information, and insights, leading to increased understanding, are always easy to distinguish. (Location 258)
    - Note: To the previous point. Even wjen they are different they can be hard to dostinguish
- the operations of learning are performed on (Location 302)
#### The Levels of Reading
- The first level of reading we will call Elementary Reading. (Location 350)
- In mastering this level, one learns the rudiments of the art of reading, receives basic training in reading, and acquires initial reading skills. (Location 352)
- The second level of reading we will call Inspectional Reading. (Location 367)
- When reading at this level, your aim is to examine the surface of the book, to learn everything that the surface alone can teach you. That is often a good deal. Whereas the question that is asked at the first level is “What does the sentence say?” the question typically asked at this level is “What is the book about?” That is a surface question; others of a similar nature are “What is the structure of the book?” or “What are its parts?” (Location 373)
- The third level of reading we will call Analytical Reading (Location 382)
- If inspectional reading is the best and most complete reading that is possible given a limited time, then analytical reading is the best and most complete reading that is possible given unlimited time. (Location 384)
- The fourth and highest level of reading we will call Syntopical Reading (Location 393)
- When reading syntopically, the reader reads many books, not just one, and places them in relation to one another and to a subject about which they all revolve. But mere comparison of texts is not enough. Syntopical reading involves more. With the help of the books read, the syntopical reader is able to construct an analysis of the subject that may not be in any of the books (Location 395)
#### The First Level of Reading: Elementary Reading
##### Stages of Learning to Read
##### Stages and Levels
##### Higher Levels of Reading and Higher Education
##### Reading and the Democratic Ideal of Education
#### The Second Level of Reading: Inspectional Reading
- The first thing to realize is that there are two types of inspectional reading. (Location 548)
##### Inspectional Reading I: Systematic Skimming or Pre-reading
- 1. LOOK AT THE TITLE PAGE AND, IF THE BOOK HAS ONE, AT ITS PREFACE (Location 564)
    - Tags: [[h4]]
- 2. STUDY THE TABLE OF CONTENTS to obtain a general sense of the book’s structure... (Location 567)
    - Tags: [[h4]]
- publishers have come to feel that a less revealing table of contents is more seductive than a completely frank and open one. (Location 576)
- 3. CHECK THE INDEX if the book has one— (Location 580)
    - Tags: [[h4]]
- When you see terms listed that seem crucial, look up at least some of the passages cited. (Location 582)
- 4. If the book is a new one with a dust jacket, READ THE PUBLISHER’S BLURB (Location 587)
    - Tags: [[h4]]
- Of course, if the blurb is nothing but a puff for the book, you will ordinarily be able to discover this at a glance. But that in itself can tell you something about the work. Perhaps the book does not say anything of importance—and that is why the blurb does not say anything, either. (Location 591)
- Upon completing these first four steps you may already have enough information about the book to know that you want to read it more carefully, or that you do not want or need to read it at all. In either case, you may put it aside for the moment. If you do not do so, you are now ready to skim the book, properly speaking. (Location 593)
- If these chapters have summary statements in their opening or closing pages, as they often do, read these statements carefully. (Location 597)
- 6. Finally, TURN THE PAGES, DIPPING IN HERE AND THERE, READING A PARAGRAPH OR TWO, SOMETIMES SEVERAL PAGES IN SEQUENCE, NEVER MORE THAN THAT. (Location 598)
    - Tags: [[h4]]
- Above all, do not fail to read the last two or three pages, or, if these are an epilogue, the last few pages of the main part of the book. Few authors are able to resist the temptation to sum up what they think is new and important about their work in these pages. You do not want to miss this, even though, as sometimes happens, the author himself may be wrong in his judgment (Location 600)
##### Inspectional Reading II: Superficial Reading
- In tackling a difficult book for the first time, read it through without ever stopping to look up or ponder the things you do not understand right away. (Location 619)
##### On Reading Speeds
- Many books are hardly worth even skimming; some should be read quickly; and a few should be read at a rate, usually quite slow, that allows for complete comprehension. (Location 658)
- With regard to rates of reading, then, the ideal is not merely to be able to read faster, but to be able to read at different speeds—and to know when the different speeds are appropriate (Location 664)
##### Fixations and Regressions
##### The Problem of Comprehension
##### Summary of Inspectional Reading
- Every book should be read no more slowly than it deserves, and no more quickly than you can read it with satisfaction and comprehension. (Location 715)
#### How to Be a Demanding Reader
##### The Essence of Active Reading: The Four Basic Questions a Reader Asks
- Ask questions while you read—questions that you yourself must try to answer in the course of reading. (Location 753)
- You must try to discover the leading theme of the book, and how the author develops this theme in an orderly way by subdividing it into its essential subordinate themes or topics. (Location 757)
- You must try to discover the main ideas, assertions, and arguments that constitute the author’s particular message. (Location 759)
    - Tags: [[h4]]
- 3. IS THE BOOK TRUE, IN WHOLE OR PART? (Location 760)
    - Tags: [[h4]]
- You have to know what is being said before you can decide whether it is true or not. When you understand a book, however, you are obligated, if you are reading seriously, to make up your own mind. Knowing the author’s mind is not enough. (Location 761)
- If the book has given you information, you must ask about its significance. Why does the author think it is important to know these things? Is it important to you to know them? And if the book has not only informed you, but also enlightened you, it is necessary to seek further enlightenment by asking what else follows, what is further implied or suggested. (Location 763)
- Reading a book on any level beyond the elementary is essentially an effort on your part to ask it questions (and to answer them to the best of your ability). That should never be forgotten. And that is why there is all the difference in the world between the demanding and the undemanding reader. The latter asks no questions—and gets no answers. (Location 767)
    - Note: You need to proactively ask questions from the book you are reading.
- Knowing what the four questions are is not enough. You must remember to ask them as you read. The habit of doing that is the mark of a demanding reader. More than that, you must know how to answer them precisely and accurately. The trained ability to do that is the art of reading. (Location 775)
    - Note: The art of reading is...
##### How to Make a Book Your Own
- Why is marking a book indispensable to reading it? First, it keeps you awake—not merely conscious, but wide awake. Second, reading, if it is active, is thinking, and thinking tends to express itself in words, spoken or written. The person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does not know what he thinks. Third, writing your reactions down helps you to remember the thoughts of the author. (Location 791)
- devices for marking a book intelligently (Location 798)
    - Tags: [[h4]]
- UNDERLINING—of major points; of important or forceful statements. (Location 799)
- VERTICAL LINES AT THE MARGIN—to emphasize a statement already underlined or to point to a passage too long to be underlined (Location 800)
- STAR, ASTERISK, OR OTHER DOODAD AT THE MARGIN—to be used sparingly, to emphasize the ten or dozen most important statements or passages in the book. You may want to fold a corner of each page on which you make such marks or place a slip of paper between the pages. In either case, you will be able to take the book off the shelf at any time and, by opening it to the indicated page, refresh your recollection. (Location 801)
    - Note: Instead of folding, use a bookmark (different color)
- WRITING IN THE MARGIN, OR AT THE TOP OR BOTTOM OF THE PAGE—to record questions (and perhaps answers) which a passage raises in your mind; to reduce a complicated discussion to a simple statement; to record the sequence of major points right through the book. The endpapers at the back of the book can be used to make a personal index of the author’s points in the order of their appearance. (Location 810)
- To inveterate book-markers, the front endpapers are often the most important. Some people reserve them for a fancy bookplate. But that expresses only their financial ownership of the book. The front endpapers are better reserved for a record of your thinking. After finishing the book and making your personal index on the back endpapers, turn to the front and try to outline the book, not page by page or point by point (you have already done that at the back), but as an integrated structure, with a basic outline and an order of parts. That outline will be the measure of your understanding of the work; unlike a bookplate, it will express your intellectual ownership of the book. (Location 813)
##### The Three Kinds of Note-making
- The questions answered by inspectional reading are: first, what kind of book is it? second, what is it about as a whole? and third, what is the structural order of the work whereby the author develops his conception or understanding of that general subject matter? (Location 823)
- Then, during an analytical reading, you will need to give answers to questions about the truth and significance of the book. The notes you make at this level of reading are, therefore, not structural but conceptual. They concern the author’s concepts, and also your own, as they have been deepened or broadened by your reading of the book. (Location 831)
##### Forming the Habit of Reading
- You cannot follow rules you do not know. Nor can you acquire an artistic habit—any craft or skill—without following rules. (Location 850)
    - Tags: 
    - Note: Rules allow us to be free to be creative
##### From Many Rules to One Habit
### The Third Level of Reading: Analytical Reading
#### Pigeonholing a Book
##### The Importance of Classifying Books
- The first rule of analytical reading can be expressed as follows: RULE 1. YOU MUST KNOW WHAT KIND OF BOOK YOU ARE READING, AND YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS AS EARLY IN THE PROCESS AS POSSIBLE, PREFERABLY BEFORE YOU BEGIN TO READ. You must know, for instance, whether you are reading fiction—a novel, a play, an epic, a lyric—or whether it is an expository work of some sort. (Location 911)
##### What You Can Learn from the Title of a Book
- We mention this common error because many think they know the title of the book, although few have actually ever read the title carefully and thought about what it means (Location 950)
    - Note: Taking the time to think is crucial for learning and understandong.
##### Practical vs. Theoretical Books
- To make knowledge practical we must convert it into rules of operation. We must pass from knowing what is the case to knowing what to do about it if we wish to get somewhere. This can be summarized in the distinction between knowing that and knowing how. Theoretical books teach you that something is the case. Practical books teach you how to do something you want to do or think you should do. (Location 1008)
    - Note: Theoretical vs Practocal
##### Kinds of Theoretical Books
- A philosopher refers the reader to his own normal and common experience for the verification or support of anything the writer has to say. Thus, Locke’s Essay Concerning Human Understanding is a philosophical work in psychology, whereas many of Freud’s writings are scientific. Locke makes every point in terms of the experience all of us have of our own mental processes. Freud can make many of his points only by reporting what he observed under the clinical conditions of the psychoanalyst’s office. (Location 1102)
    - Note: Distinction between scientific work and philosophical work.
- This does not mean that the philosopher is a pure thinker and the scientist merely an observer. Both have to observe and think, but they think about different sorts of observations. And however they may have arrived at the conclusions that they want to prove, they prove them in different ways, the scientist by pointing to the results of his special experiences, the philosopher by pointing to experiences that are common to all. (Location 1113)
- Historical statements are different from scientific and philosophical ones. A historian argues differently and interprets facts differently. Furthermore, the typical history book is narrative in form. A narrative is a narrative, whether it be fact or fiction. The historian must write poetically, which means he must obey the rules for telling a good story (Location 1122)
    - Note: History is a story that needs to be conveyed poetically. But without sacrificing the truth .
- Now, just as there is a difference in the art of teaching in different fields, so there is a reciprocal difference in the art of being taught. The activity of the student must somehow be responsive to the activity of the instructor. The relation between books and their readers is the same as that between teachers and their students. Hence, as books differ in the kinds of knowledge they have to communicate, they proceed to instruct us differently; and, if we are to follow them, we must learn to read each kind in an appropriate manner. (Location 1134)
    - Note: Different types of books need to be approached differently by readers, the same way that teacher should approach different subjects dofferently. This js why figuring out what kind of book you are reading is important.
#### X-raying a Book
- RULE 2. STATE THE UNITY OF THE WHOLE BOOK IN A SINGLE SENTENCE, OR AT MOST A FEW SENTENCES (A SHORT PARAGRAPH). (Location 1149)
- To find out what a book is about in this sense is to discover its theme or main point. (Location 1154)
- RULE 3. SET FORTH THE MAJOR PARTS OF THE BOOK, AND SHOW HOW THESE ARE ORGANIZED INTO A WHOLE, BY BEING ORDERED TO ONE ANOTHER AND TO THE UNITY OF THE WHOLE. (Location 1163)
- The analogy is almost perfect. A good book, like a good house, is an orderly arrangement of parts. Each major part has a certain amount of independence. As we will see, it may have an interior structure of its own, and it may be decorated in a different way from other parts. But it must also be connected with the other parts—that is, related to them functionally—for otherwise it would not contribute its share to the intelligibility of the whole (Location 1175)
##### Of Plots and Plans: Stating the Unity of a Book
- The plot of Tom Jones, for instance, can be reduced to the familiar formula: Boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl. That, indeed, is the plot of every romance. To recognize this is to learn what it means to say that there are only a small number of plots in the world. The difference between good and bad stories having the same essential plot lies in what the author does with it, how he dresses up the bare bones. (Location 1199)
##### Mastering the Multiplicity: The Art of Outlining a Book
- A formula can be stated for operating according to this third rule. It will guide you in a general way. According to the second rule, we had to say: The whole book is about so and so and such and such. That done, we might obey the third rule by proceeding as follows: (1) The author accomplished this plan in five major parts, of which the first part is about so and so, the second part is about such and such, the third part is about this, the fourth part about that, and the fifth part about still another thing. (2) The first of these major parts is divided into three sections, of which the first considers X, the second considers Y, and the third considers Z. (3) In the first section of the first part, the author makes four points, of which the first is A, the second B, the third C, and the fourth D. And so on and so forth (Location 1273)
- A good rule always describes the ideal performance. But a person can be skilled in an art without being the ideal artist. He can be a good practitioner if he merely approximates the rule. (Location 1283)
- Aristotle is probably the most compact of prose writers; (Location 1308)
##### The Reciprocal Arts of Reading and Writing
- The reader tries to uncover the skeleton that the book conceals. The author starts with the skeleton and tries to cover it up (Location 1370)
##### Discovering the Author’s Intentions
- ULE 4. FIND OUT WHAT THE AUTHOR’S PROBLEMS WERE. The author of a book starts with a question or a set of questions. The book ostensibly contains the answer or answers. (Location 1400)
- You should be able to state the main question that the book tries to answer, and you should be able to state the subordinate questions if the main question is complex and has many parts. (Location 1403)
- We want to emphasize, however, that we do not mean for you to fall into what is called by critics the intentional fallacy. That is the fallacy of thinking you can discover what was in an author’s mind from the book he has written. (Location 1409)
    - Tags: [[fallacy]]
- If you know the kinds of questions anyone can ask about anything, you will become adept in detecting an author’s problems (Location 1417)
    - Note: The abilikty tol see other peopls intention s can be very useful in life.
##### The First Stage of Analytical Reading
- The practiced reader accomplishes all of these stages at once. (Location 1433)
    - Note: This refers to the stages of analytical reading.
- THE FIRST STAGE OF ANALYTICAL READING, OR RULES FOR FINDING WHAT A BOOK IS ABOUT 1. Classify the book according to kind and subject matter. 2. State what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity. 3. Enumerate its major parts in their order and relation, and outline these parts as you have outlined the whole. 4. Define the problem or problems the author is trying to solve. (Location 1441)
#### Coming to Terms with an Author
##### Words vs. Terms
- RULE 5. FIND THE IMPORTANT WORDS AND THROUGH THEM COME TO TERMS WITH THE AUTHOR. Note that the rule has two parts. The first part is to locate the important words, the words that make a difference. The second part is to determine the meaning of these words, as used, with precision. (Location 1480)
    - Tags: [[rule]]
##### Finding the Key Words
- From your point of view as a reader, therefore, the most important words are those that give you trouble. It is likely that these words are important for the author as well. (Location 1547)
- It is also possible that words that are important for the author do not bother you, and precisely because you understand them. In that case, you have already come to terms with the author. Only where you fail to come to terms have you work still to do. (Location 1548)
##### Technical Words and Special Vocabularies
- The reader who fails to ponder, or at least to mark, the words he does not understand is headed for disaster. (Location 1595)
##### Finding the Meanings
- you have to discover the meaning of a word you do not understand by using the meanings of all the other words in the context that you do understand. (Location 1611)
    - Note: Kind of obvious , relates to Fluent Forever book taboo chapter. Thats the ultgijmate learning experience, contesxt

### Approaches to Different Kinds of Reading Matter
#### How to Read Practical Books
##### The Two Kinds of Practical Books
- This book cannot solve the problem for you. It can only help. You must actually go through the activity of reading, not only this book but many others. That is what it means to say that nothing but action solves practical problems, and action occurs only in the world, not in books (Location 2799)
    - Note: You cant expect everyfhing tgo changr just by reading a book. You actually need to do wkth tgat new knowledge.
- In reading a book that is primarily a rule-book, the major propositions to look for, of course, are the rules. A rule is most directly expressed by an imperative rather than a declarative sentence. It is a command. It says: “Save nine stitches by taking a stitch in time. (Location 2821)
- But there is an important difference between reading such a book and reading a purely theoretical one. Since the ultimate problems to be solved are practical—problems of action, in fields where men can do better or worse—an intelligent reader of such books about “practical principles” always reads between the lines or in the margins. He tries to see the rules that may not be expressed but that can, nevertheless, be derived from the principles. He goes further. He tries to figure out how the rules should be applied in practice. (Location 2833)
