## Highlights
- After undertaking an entire analysis, it can be tempting to want to show your audience everything, as evidence of all of the work you did and the robustness of the analysis. Resist this urge. You are making your audience reopen all of the oysters! Concentrate on the pearls, the information your audience needs to know (Page 20)
- What background information is relevant or essential? • Who is the audience or decision maker? What do we know about them? • What biases does our audience have that might make them supportive of or resistant to our message? • What data is available that would strengthen our case? Is our audience familiar with this data, or is it new? • Where are the risks: what factors could weaken our case and do we need to proactively address them? • What would a successful outcome look like? • If you only had a limited amount of time or a single sentence to tell your audience what they need to know, what would you say? In particular, I fnd that these last two questions can lead to insightful conversation. Knowing what the desired outcome is before you start preparing the communication is critical for structuring it well (Page 29)
- While it sounds easy, being concise is often more challenging than being verbose. Mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal recognized this in his native French, with a statement that translates roughly to “I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time” (a sentiment often attributed to Mark Twain) (Page 30)

- Storyboarding Storyboarding is perhaps the single most important thing you can do up front to ensure the communication you craft is on point. The storyboard establishes a structure for your communication. It is a visual outline of the content you plan to create (Page 31)
- When you can (and as makes sense), get acceptance from your client or stakeholder at this step. It will help ensure that what you’re planning is in line with the need (Page 32)
