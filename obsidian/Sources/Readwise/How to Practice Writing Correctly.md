## Highlights
- What an astonishing thing a book is. It’s a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you’re inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you.– Carl Sagan
- The best way to think is by writing. It compels your brain to connect the dots.

    - Note: Can't even count the number of times I was writing a question, only to figure it out myself, while writing it.
- Choose a topicWrite your intro, and use it to brainstorm talking pointsGet feedback on your introCreate a starting outlineExplore talking points within your outlineRewrite for clarity, succinctness, and intrigueCycle between rewriting, resting, and receiving feedbackCopy edit for grammar, word choice, and flowThere are many good ways to tell a story. Be satisfied when you’ve found one that you'd want to read yourself.
- Don't practice writing by aiming for a weekly output of words or posts. Word count is a dumb goal that measures your output volume instead of your output quality.Heck, rewriting often reduces your word count.Instead, focus on improving the clarity of your thinking and your eye for rewriting.
