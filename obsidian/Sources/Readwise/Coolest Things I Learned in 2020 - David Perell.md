## Highlights
- “For I have a single definition of success: you look in the mirror every evening, and wonder if you disappoint the person you were at 18, right before the age when people start getting corrupted by life. Let him or her be the only judge; not your reputation, not your wealth, not your standing in the community, not the decorations on your lapel. If you do not feel ashamed, you are successful. All other definitions of success are modern constructions; fragile modern constructions.”

    - Note: This is wonderful! Made me feel so good inside.
      For some reason I was feeling a little down lately, but know that if me 18 year old would look at me he would be excited about the future.
      More people need to hear about this definition of success.
- As Planck wrote: “A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it. . . An important scientific innovation rarely makes its way by gradually winning over and converting its opponents: it rarely happens that Saul becomes Paul. What does happen is that its opponents gradually die out, and that the growing generation is familiarized with the ideas from the beginning: another instance of the fact that the future lies with the youth.”
    - Note: This is certainly true, but can't be the only way change happens. Otherwise, the change would be too slow.
      Furthermore, consensus is opinion of many. I'm not sure that many that hold the same opinion can die quickly enough to not spread their convictions.
- Finishing times spike around notable goals, such as 3:00, 3:30, and 4:00. Humans are driven by goals, so we kick up our effort when the next one is in sight.
    - Note: Just reminds me how our minds affect our bodies. Psychology is a powerful force.
- If you want to live longer, focus on delaying the onset of chronic disease instead of trying to live longer once you have chronic disease.
- Buzz Feed Brain
  A phenomenon where you skim online articles instead of reading them, secretly hoping your next intellectual breakthrough is just a thumb-scroll away.
