## Highlights
- Good books are like feathers: it doesn’t take as much to launch them up into the air and they have a tendency to hang there.
  Bad books are like bricks: It take a lot to launch them into the air and they have a tendency to fall right back down.
- It’s generally better to aim high and fail, than aim low and hit.
- Sent the First Draft to 5 alpha readers
  Blogged sections of the Second Draft on my site
  Sent the Second Draft to 70 Early Readers
  Sent the Final Draft to 300 Early Ambassadors
- Blogging a book lets you do test concepts and ways of explaining them to see if they resonate. 
- Allocate resources equally between product development (writing) and marketing
