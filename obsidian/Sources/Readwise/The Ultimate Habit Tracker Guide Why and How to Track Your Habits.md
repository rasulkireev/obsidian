## Highlights
- Habit tracking is powerful for three reasons.
  It creates a visual cue that can remind you to act.
  It is motivating to see the progress you are making. You don't want to break your streak.
  It feels satisfying to record your success in the moment.
    - Note: There is a negative, too, though (for me at least). The obligation to fill it out everyday can make it cumbersome.
- Common daily habits to track:
  journal 1 sentence
  read 1 page
  meditate 1 minute
  do 1 push up
  stretch for 1 minute
  write 1 thing I'm grateful for
  make your bed
  wake up by [TIME]
  go to bed by [TIME]
  take a shower
  floss teeth
  weigh myself
  take medication
  take vitamins/supplements
  play [INSTRUMENT] for 1 minute
  contact 1 potential client
  prioritize to-do list
  say “I love you” at least once
  put all dishes put away
  take a walk outside
  call mom
  walk the dog
- I recommend using the Two-Minute Rule, which suggests you scale your habits down until they take two minutes or less to perform. You can track whatever habits you want in your habit tracker, but I recommend starting with these super small habits to make sure that you are at least showing up in a small way each day.

- For something to become truly habitual, you need to repeat it frequently. As a result, most habits are daily. But it can also be helpful to use a habit tracker for various weekly or monthly routines. These behaviors won't become “automatic” like tying your shoes or brushing your teeth, but a habit tracker can remind you to complete them nonetheless.
- Common weekly habits to track:
  publish blog post
  vacuum
  take out trash/recycling
  do the laundry
  water the plants
  tidy up your bedroom
  write a thank you note
  Monthly habits:
  review finances
  transfer money to savings account
  pay off credit cards
  pay bills
  deep clean the house
- You can also use a habit tracker to simply count how often you do something. For example, if you want to keep track of how many days you travel for work each month.
- Finally, you can use a habit tracker to measure what you don't do. I call these “habits of avoidance” (that is, behaviors you are trying to avoid).
  Habits of avoidance:
  no alcohol
  no Netflix
  no online purchases
  no soda
  no sugar
  no caffeine
  no smoking
- First, manual tracking should be limited to your most important habits. It is better to consistently track one habit than to sporadically track ten. I tend to keep my habit tracker simple and limit it to my three or four most important habits.
- Second, record each measurement immediately after the habit occurs.
- Never miss twice.
