  Settings > Inbox tab > set Inbox type: to Default > uncheck all Categories: except for Primary
- 7. Turn off all notifications
  Your email inbox is someone else’s To Do list.
- There are a lot of benefits to using a digital task manager, but for One-Touch purposes, there is one single most important feature: the program’s ability to capture and link back to email-based tasks.
