### INTRODUCTION
### PART ONE - WHAT INFLUENCES OUR THINKING
#### ONE - OUR ANATOMY SETS THE LIMITS FOR OUR BEHAVIOR
##### What we feel and think depends on neural connections
##### Genes control brain chemistry but are turned on and off by the environment
##### Interaction and flexibility characterize our biological functions
##### Neural connections are shaped by life experiences
##### influenced by our state ofmind
- Behavior is influenced by our state ofmind (Page 19)
#### Two - EVOLUTION SELECTED THE CONNECTIONS THAT PRODUCE USEFUL BEHAVIOR FOR SURVIVAL AND REPRODUCTION
##### Mutations cause variations
##### Natural selection
##### The evidence for evolution
##### Guidance through values and life experiences
##### The hunter-gatherer environment has formed our basic nature
#### Altruistic behavior cannot evolve by natural selection since natural selection favors individuals that are best at promoting their own survival and reproductive success.
- Altruistic behavior cannot evolve by natural selection since natural selection favors individuals that are best at promoting their own survival and reproductive success. Only behavior that is selfish or for the mutual good is in an individual's self-interest and therefore favored by natural selection (Page 31)
- "Whyshould a man feel that he ought to obeyone instinctive desire rather than another? (Page 31)
- THREE - ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOR FOR SURVIVAL AND REPRODUCTION (Page 31)
##### The individual comes first
##### Often cooperation is in our best interest
- As the 19th Century American President Abraham Lincoln wrote: "If you once forfeit the confidence of your fellow citizens, you can never regain their respect and esteem." (Page 33)

- partner can trust each other. Tests show that ifpeople play the game over and over, they learn that it is more profitable to cooperate. Repetition tests trust. Trust is key and fragile. It can vanish in a moment. As the 19th Century American President Abraham Lincoln wrote: "Ifyou once forfeit the confidence of your fellow citizens, you can never regain their respect and esteem." (Page 33)

##### A tendency for fear
- Failure to detect threats is often more costly than false alarms. Our ancestors learned through trial and error that in the long run, pain could be avoided ifthey were fearful. They survived the dangers because they learned how to respond (Page 35)
    - Note: In our world we need to learn not to fear. This will be be one of the hardest battles in yiur life. Its hard to go against nature.
##### Seeking explanations
##### Further studies suggest that we learn better when we mix new information with what we already know
- Limited time and knowledge in a dangerous and scarce environment made hasty generalizations and stereotyping vital for survival. Waiting and weighing evidence could mean death (Page 37)
##### Making fast classifications
- Males and females have different priorities (Page 37)
##### The Social Animal
- A real-world setting showed that people nearly trebled the amount of money they put in a psychology department coffee room box when they were watched by a pair of eyes on a poster, compared with a poster with an image of flowers (Page 40)
##### Much of our psychology is the result of cultural influences
- Richard Dawkins said in The Selfish Gene: "Be warned that if you wish, as I do, to build a society in which individuals cooperate generously and unselfishly towards a common good, you can expect little help from biological nature. Let us try to teach generosity and altruism, because we are born selfish. (Page 43)
    - Note: Most of their time
- Our genes have evolved and their functions are primarily based on what was beneficial in the hunter-gatherer environment - the environment where humans spent 33 (Page 43)

##### Our basic nature
##### Evolution has developed a value system based on pain and pleasure that help us deal with the environment. Since the ancestral environment consisted oflimited resources and danger, we developed a strong aversion for loss and a tendency for fear. We made fast evaluations and became social animals. We were predisposed to evaluate situations by being fearful. To not respond with fear could be more costly than responding with fear and being wrong. We also acted in ways where the reward was important and the cost was minimal.
- But it's not just what happens to us that counts. It's what we think happens. When we face a situation, our brains create an expectation. We can act in ways contrary to our self-interest ifwe don't understand the consequences (Page 44)
- Some decisions are not in our best interest (Page 44)
- Warren Buffett gives us some introductory remarks on why even smart people get bad results: It's ego. It's greed. It's envy. It's fear. It's mindless imitation of other people. I mean, there are a variety of factors that cause that horsepower of the mind to get diminished dramatically before the output turns out. And I would say if Charlie and I have any advantage it's not because we're so smart, it is because we're rational and we very seldom let extraneous factors interfere with our thoughts. We don't let other people's opinion 35 (Page 45)
### PART Two - THE PSYCHOLOGY OF MISJUDGMENTS
#### ONE - MISJUDGMENTS EXPLAINED BY PSYCHOLOGY
#### Experiments have shown that we can learn to fear a harmless stimulus if it is paired with an unpleasant one
- Two - PSYCHOLOGICAL REASONS FOR MISTAKES (Page 51)
- I. MERE ASSOCIATION Inside thejewelry boutique, surrounded by enchanting music andgorgeous women, how couldJohn resist not buyingMary the $5,000 necklace? We automatically feel pleasure or pain when we connect a stimulus - a thing, situation or individual- with an experience we've had in the past or with values or preferences we are born with. As we've learned, we move towards stimuli we associate with pleasure and away from those we associate with pain. We most easily associate to the events whose consequences we have experienced most often and the ones we easily remember. The more vivid or dramatic an event is, the easier we remember it. Every time Mary served bacon for breakfast, she sung a special melody. After awhile, ifJohn heard her singing the melody, he expected bacon. The Russian scientist Ivan Pavlov studied the digestive system of dogs when he observed that a stimulus unrelated to food made the dogs salivate. In one experiment he rang a bell just before giving food to the dog. He repeated this several times until the dog salivated at the sound of the bell alone. No sight or smell of food was present. The sound of the bell produced the same response as the food. The dog learned to associate the bell with food. Experiments have shown that we can learn to fear a harmless stimulus if it is paired with an unpleasant one. If for example rats consistently receive mild electrical shock after hearing a tone, the rats learn to develop a fear ofthe tone alone. Association can influence the immune system. One experiment studied food aversion in mice. Mice got saccharin-flavored water {saccharin has incentive value due to its sweet taste} along with a nausea-producing drug. Would the mice show signs ofnausea the next time they got saccharin water alone? Yes, but the mice also 42 (Page 51)
##### I. MERE ASSOCIATION
- Warren Buffett says on being informed of bad news: "We only give a couple of instructions to people when they go to work for us: One is to think like an owner. And the second is to tell us bad news immediately - because good news takes care of itself. We can take bad news, but we don't like it late. (Page 52)
- Evaluate things, situations and people on their own merits (Page 52)
##### Individuals are neither good nor bad merely because we associate them with something positive or negative.
- Encourage people to tell you bad news immediately (Page 53)
- Merely because you associate some stimulus with earlier pain or pleasure doesn't mean the stimulus will cause the same pain or pleasure today. Past experiences are often context dependent. (Page 53)
- Create a negative emotion if you want to end a certain behavior (Page 53)
- As the great 18th Century English writer Samuel Johnson said: "The chains ofhabit are too weak to be felt until they are too strong to be broken." (Page 53)
- 2. REWARD AND PUNISHMENT (Page 53)
- This automatic association to what worked in the past causes people to under-react to new conditions and circumstances. (Page 55)
    - Note: We tend not to look at separate cases in isolation preferring to use the past as a predictor.
- American statesman, scientist and philosopher Benjamin Franklin tells us that: ''A spoonful ofhoney will catch more flies than a gallon ofvinegar. " Praise is more effective in changing behavior than punishment. It is better to encourage what is right than to criticize what is wrong (Page 57)
#### feel that we are only doing it because we're paid to do it, decreases the appeal. Blaise Pascal said: "We are generally the better persuaded by the reasons we discover ourselves than by those given to us by others."
- Blaise Pascal said: "We are generally the better persuaded by the reasons we discover ourselves than by those given to us by others." (Page 58)
- Systems can be hard to change as Warren Buffett observes, "It's very hard to change a system when the guy whose hand is on the switch benefits enormously and, perhaps, disproportionatelyfrom that system." (Page 58)
- • Reward individual performance and not effort or length in organization and reward people after and not before their performance. • Don't let money be the only motivation. Ifwe reward people for doing what they like to do anyway, we sometimes turn what they enjoy doing into work. The reward changes their perception. Instead ofdoing something because they enjoy doing it, they now do it because they are being paid. The key is what a reward implies. A reward for our achievements makes us feel that we are good at something thereby increasing our motivation. But a reward that feels controlling and makes us feel that we are only doing it because we're paid to do it, decreases the appeal. Blaise Pascal said: "We are generally the better persuaded by the reasons we discover ourselves than by those given to us by others." • Install systems and rules that encourage the behavior you want. Never let it pay someone to behave in a way you don't want. Have systems that make it hard for people to get away with undesirable behavior. Make undesirable behavior costly. The painful consequences of undesirable behavior must outweigh its pleasurable consequences. For example, the consequences of spending time in jail ought to be more painful than the pleasure of getting away with burglary. • Systems can be hard to change as Warren Buffett observes, "It's very hard to change a system when the guy whose hand is on the switch benefits enormously and, perhaps, disproportionatelyfrom that system." • Decision-makers should be held accountable for the consequences of their actions. In The Case for Modern Man, American philosopher Charles Frankel defines responsibility: ''A decision is responsible when the man or group that makes it has to answer for it to those who are directly or indirectly affected by it." Charles Munger adds, ''An example of a really responsible system is the system the Romans used when they built an arch. The guy who created the arch stood under it as the scaffolding was removed. It's like packing your own parachute. " 3. SELF-INTEREST AND INCENTIVES (Page 58)
