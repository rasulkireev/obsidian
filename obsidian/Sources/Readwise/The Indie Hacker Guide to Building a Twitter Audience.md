## Highlights
- everyone should pick about 3 - 5 topics where they consistently tweet about.
  That doesn’t mean you can’t tweet about anything else. It just means these are your main topics.
- IF the tweet does well, add a tweet to at (create a thread) and link to your website.
    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
- When people visit your profile they check your header, profile pic and bio. The next thing they do, if they haven’t already left or followed you, scrolls down your timeline to check what you’re writing about. Make sure it’s not all about you and what you ate for breakfast.
- The basic rule is: always talk about them. I don’t have statistics on this but if YOU mention the word YOU in your tweet, chances are a lot bigger you’ll get more engagement while saying almost the same. They read you and think (he's talking about) me.
- Don’t be blown away but you should be commenting about 10x - 15x a day on other people's timelines vs only tweeting 2 - 3x a day on your own to start with.
    - Note: Haha, that's too much. I was thinking more in the weeks. Same numbers, just per week rather than per day.
