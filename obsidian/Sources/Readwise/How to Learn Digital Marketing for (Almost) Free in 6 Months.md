## Highlights
- When starting out, focus on being a generalist. You won’t know what you’re most interested in yet, so building up a general digital marketing skill set will help you hone in on the areas that excite you most. You’ll also be more hireable since a digital marketer who can wear a few different hats is much more useful than one who only knows how to do Instagram ads.
- Instead, write about something else you’re interested in. Some hobby you want to get better at, or some area of interest to you like psychology or history. 
- . You can always expand your channels later, but if you try to do everything at once in the beginning, you’ll burn yourself out.
- What you must be careful to avoid is spending all your time reading and thinking up new experiments and not spending enough of your time implementing and testing them. Many of these experiments will require iteration and patience, and it’ll be tempting to look around for quick wins instead. You’ll have to avoid that temptation and stick to the plan if you want to learn.

- And if you’re able to find someone you can freelance for who’s more skilled than you are, they can point out areas for you to improve that you might have missed on your own
- When you’re trying to help another company or person do what you’ve done on your own, it’ll expose areas that you aren’t as familiar with, and can help you round out your understanding of the skill
