#### The Second Cure — Control Thy Expenditures
- That what each of us calls our ‘necessary expenses’ will always grow to equal our incomes unless we protest to the contrary. (Location 452)
#### The Third Cure — Make Thy Gold Multiply
- “I tell you, my students, a man’s wealth is not in the coins he carries in his purse; it is the income he buildeth, the golden stream that continually floweth into his purse and keepeth it always bulging. (Location 488)
#### The Fourth Cure — Guard Thy Treasures from Loss
- be not too confident of thine own wisdom in entrusting thy treasures to the possible pitfalls of investments. Better by far to consult the wisdom of those experienced in handling money for profit. (Location 520)
- Guard thy treasure from loss by investing only where thy principal is safe, where it may be reclaimed if desirable, and where thou will not fail to collect a fair rental. (Location 524)
#### The Fifth Cure — Make of Thy Dwelling a Profitable Investment
- Therefore, do I recommend that every man own the roof that sheltereth him and his. (Location 536)
#### The Sixth Cure — Insure A Future Income
- Therefore do I recommend to all men, that they, by wise and well thought out methods, do provide against a lean purse in their mature years. (Location 574)
#### The Seventh Cure — Increase Thy Ability to Earn
- “Preceding accomplishment must be desire. Thy desires must be strong and definite. General desires are but weak longings. (Location 587)
- For a man to wish to be rich is of little purpose. For a man to desire five pieces of gold is a tangible desire which he can press to fulfillment. After he has backed his desire for five pieces of gold with strength of purpose to secure it, next he can find similar ways to obtain ten pieces and then twenty pieces and later a thousand pieces and, behold, he has become wealthy. (Location 588)
    - Note: Set a tangible, reachable goal.
- In learning to secure his one definite small desire, he hath trained himself to secure a larger one. This is the process by which wealth is accumulated: first in small sums, then in larger ones as a man learns and becomes more capable. (Location 590)
    - Note: Starting with small amounts will teach you to deal with larger
- “The more of wisdom we know, the more we may earn. That man who seeks to learn more of his craft shall be richly rewarded. (Location 598)
- “Thus the seventh and last remedy for a lean purse is to cultivate thy own powers, to study and become wiser, to become more skillful, to so act as to respect thyself. (Location 609)
### Meet the Goddess of Good Luck
- The spirit of procrastination is within all men. We desire riches; yet, how often when opportunity doth appear before us, that spirit of procrastination from within doth urge various delays in our acceptance. (Location 776)

- Good luck can be enticed by accepting opportunity. “Those eager to grasp opportunities for their betterment, do attract the interest of the good goddess. She is ever anxious to aid those who please her. Men of action please her best. “Action will lead thee forward to the successes thou dost desire.” Men of action are favored by the goddess of good luck. (Location 804)
### The Five Laws of Gold

Gold laboreth diligently and contentedly for the wise owner who finds for it profitable employment, multiplying even as the flocks of the field. 3. Gold clingeth to the protection of the cautious owner who invests it under the advice of men wise in its handling. 4. Gold slippeth away from the man who invests it in businesses or purposes with which he is not familiar or which are not approved by those skilled in its keep. 5. Gold flees the man who would force it to impossible earnings or who followeth the alluring advice of tricksters and schemers or who trusts it to his own inexperience and romantic desires in investment. (Location 882)
- “Wealth that stayeth to give enjoyment and satisfaction to its owner comes gradually, because it is a child born of knowledge and persistent purpose. (Location 937)
