## Highlights
- Basics #3 - Be interesting
  You don't need to be a multimillionaire or travel the world to be interesting
  You just have to do something in life worth talking about (AKA, what the average person doesn't do)
  Your twitter feed is a reflection of your life experiences
- Basics #4 - Following
  Stop following and expecting a follow back. I will not explain this further. Stop.
  Follow accounts similar to what you post and engage with their tweets consistently
  They will follow you
  Plus, following/unfollowing people multiple times warrants a block
- I've read many Twitter guides - they are good
  But TGC has the structure to hold you accountable for months on end
  You don't just buy it and forget about it, it gets you results (followers + money)

- If you sell something online... a product or service
  You need to have mentors.. or people you can mastermind with
  If you don't, your progress will seem extremely slow
  Don't be that guy that wants to "figure it out for himself"
  This is a good trait, but not in business
- Now, circling back
  If you are an absolute beginner - here is my number 1 tip
  Stop procrastinating and just start writing tweets
  Nobody is going to care if your tweets suck
  Start writing and refine your growth process as you go
  You don't need all of the answers to start.
