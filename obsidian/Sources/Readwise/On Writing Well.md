# On Writing Well
![On Writing Well-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/default-book-icon-1.a08c56e2fedd.png)

## Metadata
- Author: [[William Zinsser]]

## Highlights
- One choice is unity of pronoun. Are you going to write in the first person, as a participant, or in the third person, as an observer? (Location 796)
- Therefore ask yourself some basic questions before you start. For example: “In what capacity am I going to address the reader?” (Reporter? Provider of information? Average man or woman?) “What pronoun and tense am I going to use?” “What style?” (Impersonal reportorial? Personal but formal? Personal and casual?) “What attitude am I going to take toward the material?” (Involved? Detached? Judgmental? Ironic? Amused?) “How much do I want to cover?” “What one point do I want to make?” The last two questions are especially important (Location 823)
- Nine of my sites were super-icons: Mount Rushmore, Niagara Falls, the Alamo, Yellowstone Park, Pearl Harbor, Mount Vernon, Concord & Lexington, Disneyland, and Rockefeller Center (Location 1982)
- Nabokov’s Speak, Memory, the most elegant memoir I know, invokes a golden boyhood in czarist St. Petersburg, a world of private tutors and summer houses that the Russian Revolution would end forever (Location 2074)
