## Highlights
- The challenge of knowledge is not acquiring it. In our digital world, you can acquire almost any knowledge at almost any time.
  The challenge is knowing which knowledge is worth acquiring. And then building a system to forward bits of it through time, to the future situation or problem or challenge where it is most applicable, and most needed.
- Layer 1 is the content that I initially bring into my note-taking program. I don’t have an explicit set of criteria on what to keep. I just capture anything that feels insightful, interesting, or useful.
  This can include virtually any type of media, but for this article I will focus on text
- Layer 1 is the starting point of Progressive Summarization, like the bedrock on which everything else is built:
  Layer 2 is the first round of true summarization, in which I bold only the best parts of the passages I’ve imported. Again, I have no explicit criteria. I look for keywords, key phrases, and key sentences that I feel represent the core or essence of the idea being discussed.
