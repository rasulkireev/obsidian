# A Static Future

## Highlights
- The term “static” can be a little overloaded, and occasionally a little misleading. Here's how I'd define it:
  A static website is a website where the initial HTML is prepared ahead of time, not dynamically generated by a server on request.
- For pages consisting mostly of user-specific data, like an analytics dashboard, we probably don't want to do this (especially if that data is private/sensitive).
