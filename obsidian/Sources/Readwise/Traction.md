## Highlights
### Preface: Traction Trumps Everything
- After much brainstorming and experimenting, I eventually hit upon a good idea. I built a karma widget that would display links to your social media profiles and how many followers you had on each service. People would embed it on their sites and at the bottom there would be a link back to DuckDuckGo that said “new search engine.” This channel strategy worked beautifully. I was number one. (Location 117)
    - Note: Build a popullar widget for SEO plurposes
- We set out to help startups get traction no matter what business they were in: from Internet companies to local small businesses and everything in between. We drew on our personal experiences, interviewed more than forty founders, studied many more companies, and pulled out the repeatable framework they used to succeed. (Location 141)
    - Note: Collectively we knwo a shit load. Alwaygs ask other people
### CHAPTER ONE Traction Channels
- You can always get more traction. The whole point of a startup is to grow rapidly. Getting traction means moving your growth curve up and to the right as best you can. Paul Graham, founder of startup accelerator Y Combinator, puts it like this: A startup is a company designed to grow fast. Being newly founded does not in itself make a company a startup. Nor is it necessary for a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or have some sort of “exit.” The only essential thing is growth. Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth. (Location 163)
- most founders consider using only traction channels with which they’re already familiar, or those they think they should be using because of their type of product or company. This means that far too many startups focus on the same channels and ignore other promising ways to get traction. (Location 173)
    - Note: Same in life. We are scared of whhat we dont know
### CHAPTER TWO Traction Thinking
#### THE 50 PERCENT RULE
- Having a product or service that your early customers love, but having no clear way to get more traction is a major problem. To solve this problem, spend your time constructing your product or service and testing traction channels in parallel. (Location 270)
- Traction and product development are of equal importance and should each get about half of your attention. This is what we call the 50 percent rule: spend 50 percent of your time on product and 50 percent on traction (Location 272)
- To be clear, splitting your time evenly between product and traction will certainly slow down product development. However, it counterintuitively won’t slow the time to get your product successfully to market (Location 292)
- it helps you build the right product because you can incorporate knowledge from your traction efforts. (Location 295)
- This is exactly what happened with Dropbox. While developing their product, they tested search engine marketing and found it wouldn’t work for their business. They were acquiring customers for $230 when their product cost only $99. That’s when they focused on the viral marketing traction channel, and built a referral program right into their product. This program has since been their biggest growth driver. (Location 309)
- In contrast, waiting until you launch a product to embark on traction development usually results in one or more additional product development cycles as you adjust to real market feedback. That’s why doing traction and product development in parallel may slow down product development in the short run, but in the long run it’s the opposite. (Location 312)
- The second key benefit to parallel product and traction development is that you get to experiment and test different traction channels before you launch anything. (Location 315)
#### MOVING THE NEEDLE
- Startup growth happens in spurts. Initially, growth is usually slow. Then it spikes as a useful traction channel strategy is unlocked. Eventually it flattens out again as this strategy gets saturated and becomes less effective. Then you unlock another strategy and you get another spike. (Location 358)
- always consider your traction efforts in terms of whether they are moving the needle for your traction goal. (Location 365)
#### HOW MUCH TRACTION IS ENOUGH FOR INVESTORS?
#### TO PIVOT OR NOT TO PIVOT
- Another factor to consider before you pivot: startup founders are usually forward thinking and as a result are often too early to market, which is another reason why it’s important to choose a startup idea you’re willing to stick with for many years. (Location 403)
### CHAPTER THREE Bullseye
- Most businesses actually get zero distribution channels to work. Poor distribution—not product—is the number one cause of failure. If you can get even a single distribution channel to work, you have great business. If you try for several but don’t nail one, you’re finished. So it’s worth thinking really hard about finding the single best distribution channel. (Location 432)
#### THE OUTER RING: WHAT’S POSSIBLE
- For each channel, you should identify one decent channel strategy that has a chance of moving the needle. (Location 443)
- You should know what marketing strategies have worked in your industry, as well as the history of companies in your space. It’s especially important to understand how similar companies acquired customers over time, and how unsuccessful companies wasted their marketing dollars. (Location 446)
#### THE MIDDLE RING: WHAT’S PROBABLE
#### THE INNER RING: WHAT’S WORKING
#### WHY USE BULLSEYE?
#### COMPARISON TO LEAN
- The biggest mistake startups make when trying to get traction is failing to pursue traction in parallel with product development. Many entrepreneurs think that if you build a killer product, your customers will beat a path to your door. This line of thinking is a fallacy: that the best use of your time is always improving your product. In other words, “if you build it, they will come” is wrong. You are much more likely to develop a good distribution strategy with a good traction development methodology (like Bullseye) the same way you are much more likely to develop a good product with a good product development methodology (like Lean). Both help address major risks that face early-stage companies: market risk (that you can reach customers in a sustainable way) and product risk (that customers want what you’re building). Pursuing both traction and product in parallel will increase your chances of success by both developing a product for which you can actually get traction and getting traction with that product much sooner. (Location 521)
### CHAPTER FOUR Traction Testing
#### MIDDLE RING TESTS
- In particular, your tests should be designed to answer these questions: How much does it cost to acquire each customer through this channel strategy? How many customers are available through this channel strategy? Are the customers you are getting through this channel the ones you want right now? (Location 550)
- Middle ring tests arm you with data that you can use to compare channel strategies (Location 562)
#### INNER RING TESTS
- Making A/B testing a habit (even if you run just one test a week) will improve your efficiency in a traction channel by two or three times. There are many tools to help you do this type of testing online, such as Optimizely, Visual Website Optimizer, and Unbounce (Location 579)
#### ONLINE TOOLS
- This “effective tracking and reporting system” can be as simple as a spreadsheet or as complex as an analytics tool that does cohort analysis, but it must exist (Location 620)
- In fact, a basic analytics tool like Clicky, Mixpanel, or Chartbeat can help you answer all three of these questions. These tools tell you who is coming to your site, at what frequency, and, perhaps most important, when and where they are leaving your site. We (Location 628)
- At a minimum, include the columns of how many customers are available, conversion rate, cost to acquire a customer, and lifetime value of a customer for a given strategy. Because these metrics are universal, you can use them to easily make comparisons across strategies. In general, we encourage you to be as quantitative as possible, even if it is just guesstimating at first (Location 632)
### CHAPTER FIVE Critical Path
#### DEFINING YOUR TRACTION GOAL
#### DEFINING YOUR CRITICAL PATH
- hard reassessment after each milestone is necessary. The best way to make sure you’re not squandering your resources is to keep reevaluating whether what you’re doing is on your Critical Path. (Location 700)
#### OVERCOMING YOUR TRACTION BIASES
- To refresh your memory, here are the nineteen channels: Targeting Blogs Publicity Unconventional PR Search Engine Marketing (SEM) Social and Display Ads Offline Ads Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Content Marketing Email Marketing Viral Marketing Engineering as Marketing Business Development (BD) Sales Affiliate Programs Existing Platforms Trade Shows Offline Events Speaking Engagements Community Building (Location 707)
- There are three reasons why founders ignore potentially profitable traction channels: Out of sight, out of mind. Startups generally don’t think of things like speaking engagements because they are usually out of their field of vision. Some founders refuse to seriously consider channels they view negatively, like sales or affiliate marketing. Just because you hate talking on the phone doesn’t mean your customers do. Bias against schlep—things that seem annoying and time-consuming. Channels like business development and trade shows often fall into this category. (Location 721)
### CHAPTER SIX Targeting Blogs
- Not all traction channels are infinitely scalable. In fact, using tactics that don’t scale is one of the best ways to get your first customers. Paul Graham put it like this: The need to do something unscalably laborious to get started is so nearly universal that it might be a good idea to stop thinking of startup ideas as scalars. Instead we should try thinking of them as pairs of what you’re going to build, plus the unscalable thing(s) you’re going to do initially to get the company going. (Location 759)
#### TARGETING BLOG TACTICS
- Search Engines—Simply (Location 811)
- YouTube—Doing (Location 813)
- Delicious—Delicious allows you to use keywords to find links that others have saved, which can unearth new blogs (Location 816)
- Twitter—Using (Location 817)
- Talk to People—The (Location 821)
- In addition to targeting blogs directly, you can also target the link-sharing communities that often link to them. Sharing links is at the heart of many large communities on the Web (e.g., reddit, Product Hunt, Hacker News, Inbound.org). In addition, there are hundreds of niche communities and forums that encourage and reward the sharing of links (Location 822)
### CHAPTER SEVEN Publicity
#### PUBLICITY STRATEGY
- This means you no longer have to pitch CNN directly if you want to get on TV. Instead, you can pitch smaller sites (ones that are easier to get coverage from) whose content is often picked up by larger media outlets (Location 875)
- When pitching to any media outlet, it’s your job to also create an angle that makes your story compelling. If you can craft a narrative and present it well, you greatly increase your chances of getting a story written. (Location 916)
- As Ryan said, “satisfaction is a nonviral emotion”—you want readers to do something after reading your piece, not just feel satisfied. (Location 920)
#### PUBLICITY TACTICS
- A good first step is using a service like Help A Reporter Out (HARO), where reporters request sources for articles they are working on. While you won’t be the centerpiece of the article, assisting a reporter in this way will get you a mention in the piece and help establish your credibility. (Location 938)
- You can also use Twitter to reach reporters online. Almost all reporters have Twitter accounts, and you’d be surprised at how few followers many of them have (Location 943)
- Once you have a solid story, you want to draw as much attention to it as you can. Here are a few ways to do it: Submit the story to link-sharing sites (reddit, Hacker News) with larger audiences. Share it on social networks to drive awareness, which you can further amplify with social ads. Email it to influencers in your industry for comment. Some of them will share it with their audiences. Ping blogs in your space and tell them that you have a story that’s getting some buzz. These writers may then want to jump in themselves to cover you. (Location 949)
- In addition to driving traffic, publicity can have a substantial impact on your fund-raising efforts. Ryan Holiday talked about this in our interview: PR has a huge impact on early-stage startups. . . . Funding is obviously very important. But funding is essentially gambling. You’re saying, “I think this unproven person deserves two million dollars of my money to build a business that may or may not succeed, and if it does succeed we need to find a buyer who will pay even more to take it off our hands.” There are so many things that can go wrong. When people gamble, but they don’t tell themselves they’re gambling (as investors do), they need information to justify their decisions, and they need social proof and examples and evidence that they’re doing the right thing. They already know if they want to invest in you or not, and they’re looking for confirmation that they made the right call. Press is one of the single most effective things for pushing people over the edge and confirming they did the right thing. (Location 957)
### CHAPTER EIGHT Unconventional PR
#### PUBLICITY STUNTS
#### CUSTOMER APPRECIATION
- Good customer support is so rare that, if you simply try to make your customers happy, they are likely to spread the news of your awesome product on that basis alone (Location 1057)
#### CASE STUDY: DAVID HAUSER
#### TARGETS
- Be awesome to your customers and good things follow. (Location 1097)

### CHAPTER NINE Search Engine Marketing (SEM)
- Cost per Acquisition (CPA)—CPA is a measure of how much it costs you to acquire a customer, not just a click. (Location 1119)
#### CASE STUDY: INFLECTION
#### SEM STRATEGY
- Bing Ads (with its ads running on Yahoo!, Bing, and DuckDuckGo) is also worth looking at. We (Location 1157)
- Other tools such as KeywordSpy, SEMrush, and SpyFu are valuable for discovering keywords your competition uses to attract customers. (Location 1161)
#### SEM TACTICS
### CHAPTER TEN Social and Display Ads
- Billion-dollar brands such as Rolex, American Apparel, and other household names pay millions each year for social and display ads that push their brands to the forefront of consumers’ minds. This is one of the larger traction channels, in which companies spend more than $15 billion a year. (Location 1248)
#### DISPLAY ADS
- Another network, BuySellAds, offers advertisers a self-service platform for buying ads directly from publishers. In addition to buying and selling display advertising, BuySellAds allows advertisers to purchase space on mobile Web sites, Twitter accounts, mobile apps, email newsletters, and RSS feeds. With its flexibility and low starting cost, BuySellAds is an easy way to start testing this traction channel (Location 1270)
#### SOCIAL ADS
### CHAPTER ELEVEN Offline Ads
#### OFFLINE ADS STRATEGY
#### PRINT ADVERTISING
- No matter how well you’ve targeted your audience, your magazine ad will not get a good response unless it is well designed. A compelling magazine ad will have an attention-grabbing header, an eye-catching graphic, and a tagline or description of the product’s benefits. Jason Cohen mentioned that the Smart Bear ads that performed well all had a strong call to action: in his case, the offer for that free book. (Location 1427)
#### OUTDOOR ADVERTISING
#### RADIO AND TV ADVERTISING
#### CONCLUSION
### CHAPTER TWELVE Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
- Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving your ranking in search engines in order to get more people to your site (Location 1538)
#### SEO STRATEGY
#### Fat-head Strategy
- Using tools like Open Site Explorer, examine the number of links competitors have for a given term. (Location 1576)
#### Long-Tail Strategy
- A second way to evaluate a long-tail strategy is to look at the analytics software you have on your site (such as Google Analytics or Clicky). These applications will tell you some of the search terms people are using to get to your site right now. (Location 1596)
#### SEO TACTICS
- Here are some ways to build links:
  - Publicity—when you are covered by online publications, reporters will link to your Web site.
  - Product—with some products, you can produce Web pages as part of your product that people naturally want to share. A great example is LinkedIn profile pages.
  - Content marketing—creating strong, relevant content that people want to read, and thus share.
  - Widgets—giving site owners useful things to add to their sites, which also contain links back to yours. (Location 1640)
#### CONCLUSION
#### TARGETS
### CHAPTER THIRTEEN Content Marketing
#### CASE STUDY: UNBOUNCE
- They also engaged with their target customers by writing useful answers on targeted forums like Quora (Location 1710)
#### CASE STUDY: OKCUPID
#### CONTENT MARKETING TACTICS
- Unbounce found that infographics are shared about twenty times more often than a typical blog post and have a higher likelihood of getting picked up by other online publications. (Location 1735)
- The secret to shareable content is showing readers they have a problem they didn’t know about, or at least couldn’t fully articulate. (Location 1741)
- In the early days, it’s unlikely that your blog will see much traffic, regardless of content quality. Even Unbounce was receiving less than eight hundred monthly visits after six months of consistently putting out good content. It took awhile longer for the blog to grow to twenty thousand monthly visitors (Location 1743)
#### CONCLUSION
- Having a strong company blog can positively impact at least eight other traction channels—SEO, publicity, email marketing, targeting blogs, community building, offline events, existing platforms, and business development. (Location 1764)
### CHAPTER FOURTEEN Email Marketing
- EMAIL MARKETING FOR FINDING CUSTOMERS (Location 1793)
- At the bottom of your blog posts and landing pages, simply ask for an email address (Location 1799)
- Another popular approach to building an email list is creating a short, free course related to your area of expertise. These mini-courses are meant to educate potential customers about your problem space and product. At the end of the course you put a call to action, such as asking people to purchase your product, start a free trial, or share something with their friends. (Location 1801)
#### EMAIL MARKETING FOR ENGAGING CUSTOMERS
- Customer activation is a critical and often-overlooked component of building a successful product. “Activating” a customer means getting them to engage with your product enough that they are an active customer. For Twitter, it specifically means sending out a tweet or following five people. For Dropbox, it means successfully installing the application and uploading at least one file. As you would expect, improving your activation rates can have a significant effect on your business (Location 1807)
- Email marketing is a great way to improve your customer activation rates. A popular approach is to create a sequence of emails that slowly exposes your new customers to the key features in your product. Instead of throwing everything at them right away, you can email them five days after they’ve signed up and say, “Hey, did you know we have this feature (Location 1812)
#### EMAIL MARKETING FOR RETAINING CUSTOMERS
- Any sort of communication telling your customers how well they’re doing is likely to go over well. (Location 1846)
    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
#### EMAIL MARKETING FOR REVENUE
#### EMAIL MARKETING FOR REFERRALS
- If a friend signs up, both people get extra free space. This referral program built on top of email has been Dropbox’s biggest growth mechanism and has led to tens of millions of users. (Location 1878)
#### EMAIL MARKETING TACTICS
- Deliverability is a key factor in email. For many technical reasons, your email messages may not be reaching their intended recipients (Location 1883)
### CHAPTER FIFTEEN Viral Marketing
#### VIRAL MARKETING STRATEGY
- The oldest form of virality occurs when your product is so remarkable that people naturally tell others about it—pure word of mouth. (Location 1935)
- and TV shows to take off. Inherent virality occurs when you can get value from a product only by inviting other customers. For example, if your friends don’t have Skype, the application is worthless. (Location 1938)
- This type of viral loop can take longer to spread if your customers don’t need to immediately collaborate. However, once they do, strong network effects kick in as the service becomes a central tool around which collaboration occurs. (Location 1943)
- On each video page, YouTube provides the code snippet necessary to embed a video on any Web site. You’ve probably also noticed such buttons for Facebook and Twitter on many Web pages: each button encourages sharing, which exposes the product to more and more people. (Location 1952)
- Any viral coefficient above 1 will result in exponential growth, meaning that each new user brings in more than one additional user, creating true exponential growth. Any viral coefficient over 0.5 helps your efforts to grow considerably. (Location 1973)
- Viral cycle time explains the explosive growth of a company like YouTube, whose cycle times can occur in a matter of minutes—someone sees a video, clicks on it to go to the site, then copies the link and sends it to friends. Shortening your viral cycle time drastically increases the rate at which you go viral, and is one of the first things you should focus on improving if using this channel. To shorten it, create urgency or incentivize customers to move through your viral loops. Additionally, make every step in your funnel as simple as possible to increase the number of people who complete it. (Location 1990)
#### VIRAL MARKETING TACTICS
- Literally draw a map of the entire process and try cutting out unnecessary steps (extra signup pages, unnecessary forms or fields to fill out, etc.) and increase areas or mechanisms where customers can send out invitations. Doing so will improve your viral equation by increasing your invites sent and your conversion percentage. (Location 2009)
### CHAPTER SIXTEEN Engineering as Marketing
#### ENGINEERING AS MARKETING STRATEGY
- Another company that nails engineering as marketing is Moz, the leader in SEO software. Two of its free SEO tools, Followerwonk and Open Site Explorer, have driven tens of thousands of leads for Moz. (Location 2107)
- A key feature of these tools is their ease of use: prospects simply go to the site and enter a domain name or Twitter handle. (Location 2110)
    - Note: Apps need to be super simple. Lowest possibl inoit from iser with maximum output from app
#### ENGINEERING AS MARKETING TACTICS
- To really maximize impact, put your microsites and tools on their own domains. This simple technique does two things. First, it makes them much easier to share. Second, you can do well with SEO by picking a name that people search often so your tool is more naturally discoverable. (Location 2146)
#### CASE STUDY: RJMETRICS
#### CONCLUSION
- When you build valuable tools for prospective customers, you get more leads, a stronger brand, and increased awareness while also solving a problem for the individuals you want to target. (Location 2177)
- With sales, you’re selling directly to a customer. With business development, you’re partnering to reach customers in a way that benefits both parties. (Location 2204)
