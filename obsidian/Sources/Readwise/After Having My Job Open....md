## Highlights
- 3. Make it easy to find your work! Whether it's github projects, blog posts, codepens, make it easy to find on your CV so we can quickly jump in and understand a bit about where you are in your journey. Again, it distinguishes you from the crowd.
- 4. If possible, get feedback on your projects *before* applying. For instance, if you have open-source code on GitHub: ask a friend or someone in the community to give you feedback on how to improve it. I did this for my sister, for example.
- 6. Keep practicing. It's controversial but a 3-month bootcamp does not make you *immediately employable* just because you finished it. You need to keep working on your skills after that, *especially* when employers have a choice of 100s of similarly eager candidates.
- P.s. If you love teaching juniors, we have a number of senior frontend roles up now @SumUpEng. We're looking for the next cohort to build up teams that can support junior devs in the future.
  I hope this helps! If you have more tips, feel free to append them below :)
