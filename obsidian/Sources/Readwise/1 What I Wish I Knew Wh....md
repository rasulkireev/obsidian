## Highlights
- 2/ * Read every day. It doesn't matter what. It doesn't matter if you "finish the book". Just read.
- 3/ * Find mentors who have achieved success in what I want (love, happiness, community, parenting, financial)
- 4/ * Double down on what's working and don't stop until it stops working
- 5/ * Avoid shiny new distractions. AKA Focus. AKA see above.
- 6/ * Prioritize learning from history. AKA you aren't special. Cheat code = read books that have lasted the test of time AKA old books.
- 8/ * Momentum is all the things. Keep the streak going. Search for the perfect wave and ride it as long as you can.
- 10/ * Psychology. Study it and restudy it. Understanding Social Psychology, human decision making, and cognitive biases is worth more than all the leadership, business and self-help books in the world. Seriously.
- 11/ * Be patient. A few great actions/bets repeated is worth a million tiny actions.
- 13/ * Save for a rainy day as it always comes.
- 14/ * Learning only from your failures sucks. Learning from other people's failures is the only real productivity hack there is. Ignore this and lead a life full of pain and misery.
- 16/ * Learn to tell stories well. At the end of the day most of success comes down to storytelling. The stories you tell yourself as well as those you tell the world.

- 17/ * Never read/watch the News. Please. You'll live a more peaceful and rich life without it.
- 18/ * Invest in relationships. Your community matters more than you think.

- 19/ * Avoid consensus. Avoid conventional wisdom. That is unless you want average results.
- 25/ What did I miss?
