## Highlights
- before marrying my wife we had a lot of conversations about “what love is.”
  my definition is giving someone a big red button, with instructions that pushing it would destroy you, then saying “please don’t push it.”
  put another way, my definition of love is Vulnerability; complete and utter surrender to your partner.
