## Highlights
- Each of us has work that energizes us and work that drains us. Writing energizes me. Sales drains me. A good test to figure this out is: how do you feel when you see a type of work on your tasks for the day? 
    - Note: Making calls is draining. Writing code is not, especially when you know what you are doing.
