## Highlights
- Here’s how Sponsorware works:
  Create a cool piece of software
  Make it exclusive to people who sponsor you until you reach a certain number of sponsors
  Then open source the project to the world
- All of this works because I spent years and years honing my craft and producing software that is truly useful.

    - Note: There is just no way around this. You have to learn and gain experience!
- The work people are sponsoring for has to be quality and remain the #1 priority.
- Building an audience is ESSENTIAL for any of this to work. Twitter followers and email subscribers are your most valuable asset.
- The biggest mistake people make with GitHub sponsors is offering too small of a first tier.
  If people have the option of paying $1-5/mo. instead of >$14, they will pay the lesser amount.
