## Highlights
- I’m fed up with entrepreneurship Twitter.  I’m tired of hearing about side hustles, the 4-hour work week, and escaping the rat race.  Not because I am against any of these pursuits in and of themselves, but because of the culture projected by many of those who pursue them.  I call this the entrepreneurship superiority complex.
    - Note: I've got to say that my Twitter thread is absolutely the same, and I am getting a little tired of it. 
      The thing is that I am the one who curated this list of follows who post this content. This means I either have to do some cleanup up, or follow a more diverse group of people.
- The issue isn’t how you earn your income, but what you do with it.
    - Note: In many things "how" you do is more important then "what" you do. Derek Sivers said in one of his posts that execution is worth much more than the idea.
- There is No Right Way to Work
    - Note: Life is cool. It's not black and white like some people think. There are indeed a million way to reach a goal that you have in mind.
