## Highlights
- People don’t read books—and the ones that do aren’t buying them.
- Many authors hope that securing a contract with a Big Four publishing house will provide more marketing and sell more copies of the book, but the reality is that traditional publishers are looking for a sure thing. They want an author who already has an existing platform and can guarantee an audience. And if the author has that, they might be better off going it alone.
    - Note: The paradox... Why publishing houses even exist now? Only to make sure that the book reaches a wider market (while decreasing the author profit). That would only make sense if the author doesn't care about money, but about reach/influence.
- Theoretically then, an author could release a new chapter every week, charge subscribers $8 or $9 a month, and earn $100,000 a year—from only 1,000 readers
- peonies are native to China and mischievous nymphs were said to hide in their petals.
    - Note: Interesting fact :) I love peonies
