## Highlights
- 2. Read Foundational Books – Often Mentioned in The Bibliography Section
- But these elaborate creations full of complicated phrases are what you need to level up your thinking.
    - Note: One could argue that it shouldn't be hard to read, the job of the author is to make it easy. But, I think, Ivaylo is right, good books that alter the way you think tend to be the ones with complicated phrases.
- We don’t hop online with clear goals in mind. We surf the net hoping to find “something” that will entertain us.
    - Note: Agreed. I've been thinking a lot about "intention" recently. It really pays to live life with intention. Thinking about your goals, actions, instead of mindlessly going with the flow.
- Reading is just part of the equation. You should also make time for doing.
    - Note: I think a lot of people forget about this. Well, I can only speak for myself, and I certainly don't "do" enough. I think it was Tim Ferriss, who said that "reading can be a form of procrastination".
- A nasty side effect of a regular reading habit, except probably spending a fortune on books, is a growing resentfulness towards vanity and stupidity.
  You become idiot intolerable.
    - Note: Yes, yes, a million times yes. I have been feeling it for months now, but never saw someone put this in words. Thanks, I now understand my negative attitude to some people, who never caused this feeling before.
- You simply become more aware of suppressing problems that exist in the universe.
  You start to see flaws in the system that is trying to control our lives. You find exploits in the human mind. You realize how people are wrongly spending their time and money. But worst of all, you see how these people are not doing anything to make things better for them.
- You get bothered because most of the people you talk with are not doing anything to solve these problems. They simply add more burden to their lives and avoid taking responsibility by blaming others or the system for their struggles.
- I’ve come to the realization that you don’t have to convince someone of something. This will only worsen your relationship. The best you can do is to steer him towards the right direction where he can (potentially) learn about this himself.
    - Note: This is absolutely true, trying to teach someone how to live will make the relationship with that person worse. One needs to be delicate when trying to help with advice. I thought about it quite a bit, but have not found a good way to do that. Perhaps, I need to find a good book for that.
