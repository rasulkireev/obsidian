## Highlights
- The defining element of the novice is a reliance on recipes. Novices need clear instructions on how to do something in order to do it. They don’t have an intuitive understanding of the skill, so they need someone else’s recipes to follow in order to complete any task within the skill.
- The key here is to not beat yourself up when things go wrong, but rather to use it as data
- The defining characteristic of the Proficient is an intuitive sense of what the goal should be given the situation. 
- the expert intuitively knows what they should do and does it
- What I’d recommend, again, is that even if you think you’re proficient or an expert, assume you’re an advanced beginner. This keeps with the concept of Shoshin or “Beginner’s Mind.” If you assume you’re an expert then learning stops, and it’s better to assume you’re more of a novice and that there’s more to learn than to assume you already know everything.
- The only way you graduate from novice is by breaking away from fixed recipes. You need to try improvising, combining recipes, and letting yourself make mistakes. More importantly, when something goes wrong, start looking for how to solve it without blaming the recipe.
- To become Proficient, keep practicing and collecting more experience until your chosen perspective becomes intuitive. Until you have a sense of what to focus on and what goals to set instead of having to choose it deliberately.
- The move from proficient to expert will take the longest, so be patient with it. Keep practicing, keep experimenting, and with time, you’ll develop the intuition you need.
