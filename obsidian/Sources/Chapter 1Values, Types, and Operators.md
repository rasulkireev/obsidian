## Highlights
- For example, we can express the number 13 in bits. It works the same way as a decimal number, but instead of 10 different digits, you have only 2, and the weight of each increases by a factor of 2 from right to left. Here are the bits that make up the number 13, with the weights of the digits shown below them:
  0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1
  128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
  So that’s the binary number 00001101. Its non-zero digits stand for 8, 4, and 1, and add up to 13
