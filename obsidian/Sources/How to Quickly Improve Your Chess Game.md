## Highlights
- 1. Fast improvers play much more chess games.
- Recommendation: Aim for about 10 quick games on most days if you want to improve as quickly as possible. Or just play a game or two more than you are playing now to steadily improve at a more moderate rate. The key is to play, play, play.
    - Note: 10 games a day is a lot. I can do 3 a day max. This should still be sufficient for learning opportunities, especially at the beginning.
- Recommendation: After every game, take just a few moments to review your Game Report and analyze or retry your mistakes. It doesn’t take long, but it makes a significant difference when you learn from your actual mistakes in your own games.
    - Note: This is not mentioned, but I am 100% sure that putting your errors into a SRS like Anki will aid you even more.
- Recommendation: Try to complete one Lesson per day. Each lesson takes just about five minutes to complete, but the overall impact on your game really adds up over time.
