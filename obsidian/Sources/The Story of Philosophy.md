### INTRODUCTION On the Uses of Philosophy
- Philosophy is a hypothetical interpretation of the unknown (as in metaphysics), or of the inexactly known (as in ethics or political philosophy); it is the front trench in the siege of truth. Science is the captured territory; and behind it are those secure regions in which knowledge and art build our imperfect and marvelous world. Philosophy seems to stand still, perplexed; but only because she leaves the fruits of victory to her daughters the sciences, and herself passes on, divinely discontent, to the uncertain and unexplored. (Location 318)
    - Note: Philosophy aLwaYs tackles t hardssr things
- complete except in relation to a purpose and a whole. Science without philosophy, facts without perspective and valuation, cannot save us from havoc and despair. Science gives us knowledge, but only philosophy can give us wisdom. (Location 332)
- philosophy means and includes five fields of study and discourse: logic, esthetics, ethics, politics, and metaphysics. (Location 334)
    - Note: Miain areas of philosophy
- Ethics is the study of ideal conduct; the highest knowledge, said Socrates, is the knowledge of good and evil, the knowledge of the wisdom of life. (Location 339)
### CHAPTER ONE Plato
#### I. The Context of Plato
- In 490–470 B.C. Sparta and Athens, forgetting their jealousies and joining their forces, fought off the effort of the Persians under Darius and Xerxes to turn Greece into a colony of an Asiatic empire. In this struggle of youthful Europe against the senile East, Sparta provided the army and Athens the navy. The war over, Sparta demobilized her troops, and suffered the economic disturbances natural to that process; while Athens turned her navy into a merchant fleet, and became one of the greatest trading cities of the ancient world. Sparta relapsed into agricultural seclusion and stagnation, while Athens became a busy mart and port, the meeting place of many races of men and of diverse cults and customs, whose contact and rivalry begot comparison, analysis and thought. (Location 379)
    - Note: War always brings hunger and despair. Athenians were lucky to reclver quickly. This could a gookd lesson to think ahead.
#### II. Socrates
- and he could drink like a gentleman—without fear and without excess. (Location 438)
- But no doubt they liked best in him the modesty of his wisdom: he did not claim to have wisdom, but only to seek it lovingly; he was wisdom’s amateur, not its professional. It was said that the oracle at Delphi, with unusual good sense, had pronounced him the wisest of the Greeks; and he had interpreted this as an approval of the agnosticism which was the starting-point of his philosophy—“One thing only I know, and that is that I know nothing.” Philosophy begins when one learns to doubt—particularly to doubt one’s cherished beliefs, one’s dogmas and one’s axioms. (Location 439)
- There is no real philosophy until the mind turns round and examines itself. Gnothi seauton, said Socrates: Know thyself. (Location 444)
#### III. The Preparation of Plato
- He had knowledge, and he had art; for once the philosopher and the poet lived in one soul; and he created for himself a medium of expression in which both beauty and truth might find room and play—the dialogue. (Location 565)
    - Note: Plato
#### IV. The Ethical Problem
- We have here the fundamental problem of ethics, the crux of the theory of moral conduct. What is justice?—shall we seek righteousness, or shall we seek power?—is it better to be good, or to be strong? (Location 635)
    - Note: Strong dictate rules for all. Good people will have to work with waht they are given.
#### V. The Political Problem
- “Any ordinary city is in fact two cities, one the city of the poor, the other of the rich, each at war with the other; and in either division there are smaller ones—you would make a great mistake if you treated them as single states” (423). (Location 664)
- But even democracy ruins itself by excess—of democracy. Its basic principle is the equal right of all to hold office and determine public policy. This is at first glance a delightful arrangement; it becomes disastrous because the people are not properly equipped by education to select the best rulers and the wisest courses (588). “As to the people they have no understanding, and only repeat what their rulers are pleased to tell them” (Protagoras, 317); to get a doctrine accepted or rejected it is only necessary to have it praised or ridiculed in a popular play (a hit, no doubt, at Aristophanes, whose comedies attacked almost every new idea). Mob-rule is a rough sea for the ship of state to ride; every wind of oratory stirs up the waters and deflects the course. The upshot of such a democracy is tyranny or autocracy; the crowd so loves flattery, it is so “hungry for honey,” that at last the wiliest and most unscrupulous flatterer, calling himself the “protector of the people” rises to supreme power (565). (Consider the history of Rome.) (Location 675)
    - Note: I guess this is the approach Trump took.
- To devise a method of barring incompetence and knavery from public office, and of selecting and preparing the best to rule for the common good—that is the problem of political philosophy. (Location 688)
    - Note: At some point in Rome, the ruler was chosen and preplared by the current ruler. This systfem wored wokmders them
#### VI. The Psychological Problem
- to understand politics, we must, unfortunately, understand psychology. “Like man, like state” (575); “governments vary as the characters of men vary; . . . states are made out of the human natures which are in them” (544); the state is what it is because its citizens are what they are. Therefore we need not expect to have better states until we have better men; till then all changes will leave every essential thing unchanged. (Location 691)
    - Note: Is there a solution to that? Probably not. Even worse, it feels like the quality of humanityh has decreased in recent decades.
#### VII. The Psychological Solution
- let early education be rather a sort of amusement; this will better enable you to find out the natural bent of the child (536). (Location 768)
- Therefore the essence of a higher education is the search for Ideas: for generalizations, laws of sequence, and ideals of development; behind things we must discover their relation and meaning, their mode and law of operation, the function and ideal they serve or adumbrate; we must classify and coördinate our sense experience in terms of law and purpose; only for lack of this does the mind of the imbecile differ from the mind of Caesar. (Location 837)
    - Note: The making of a smart man the seaech of Ideas
#### VIII. The Political Solution
- Nor shall any man hold office without specific training, nor hold high office till he has first filled a lower office well (Gorgias, 514–5). (Location 859)
    - Note: Reading this makes ne think the system is great, but then the reality hits. What if the ruler wants to keep the power for as long as ossible or wants to change to a different ideology, or anything like that . We have to alway consider the unplredictability of men. Thus the perfect system must somehow account for this. In fact this shoukd be of atmost priority, because any system that is not sustainable om itself cant be trusted and iz thus worth nokthimg.
#### IX. The Ethical Solution
- There are only three things worth while in this world—justice, beauty and truth; and perhaps none of them can be defined. (Location 956)
- But for justice Plato ventures a definition. “Justice,” he says, “is the having and doing what is one’s own” (433). (Location 958)

#### X. Criticism
#### I. The Historical Background
- Aristotle had spent money lavishly in the collection of books (that is, in those printless days, manuscripts); he was the first, after Euripides, to gather together a library; and the foundation of the principles of library classification was among his many contributions to scholarship. (Location 1129)
- “For a while,” says Plutarch, “Alexander loved and cherished Aristotle no less than as if he had been his own father; saying that though he had received life from the one, the other had taught him the art of living.” (“Life,” says a fine Greek adage, “is the gift of nature; but beautiful living is the gift of wisdom.”) (Location 1160)

#### II. The Work of Aristotle
- When, in the fifty-third year of his age, Aristotle established his school, the Lyceum, (Location 1179)
    - Note: Licey
- See, here, how inventions make history: for lack of a telescope Aristotle’s astronomy is a tissue of childish romance; for lack of a microscope his biology wanders endlessly astray. (Location 1205)
    - Note: Were those devices created for the reason tgat they are used?
- we can hardly speak of any science today without employing terms which he invented; they lie like fossils in the strata of our speech: faculty, mean, maxim (meaning, in Aristotle, the major premiss of a syllogism), category, energy, actuality, motive, end, principle, form—these indispensable coins of philosophic thought were minted in his mind. (Location 1232)
- Aristotle, too, wrote literary dialogues, as highly reputed in their day as Plato’s; but they are lost, just as the scientific treatises of Plato have perished. Probably time has preserved of each man the better part. (Location 1236)
#### III. The Foundation of Logic
- The first great distinction of Aristotle is that almost without predecessors, almost entirely by his own hard thinking, he created a new science—Logic. (Location 1248)
    - Note: Imagijne creatijng a whoe new field of snce from scratch...
- Logic means, simply, the art and method of correct thinking. It is the logy or method of every science, of every discipline and every art; and even music harbors it. It is a science because to a considerable extent the processes of correct thinking can be reduced to rules like physics and geometry, and taught to any normal mind; it is an art because by practice it gives to thought, at last, that unconscious and immediate accuracy which guides the fingers of the pianist over his instrument to effortless harmonies. Nothing is so dull as logic, and nothing is so important. (Location 1259)
    - Note: Uni course on logic was hard .time to give ikt another try.
- “If you wish to converse with me,” said Voltaire, “define your terms.” (Location 1265)
    - Tags: [[quote]] 
    - Note: Rules allow the beauty to happen
- There was, in the Socratic-Platonic demand for definitions, a tendency away from things and facts to theories and ideas, from particulars to generalities, from science to scholasticism; at last Plato became so devoted to generalities that they began to determine his particulars, so devoted to ideas that they began to define or select his facts. Aristotle preaches a return to things, to the “unwithered face of nature” and reality; he had a lusty preference for the concrete particular, for the flesh and blood individual. But Plato so loved the general and universal that in the Republic he destroyed the individual to make a perfect state. (Location 1289)
    - Note: Plato is about generalities while Aristotle about actualities, facts
- Aristotle’s contributions to philosophy—the doctrine of the syllogism. A syllogism is a trio of propositions of which the third (the conclusion) follows from the conceded truth of the other two (the “major” and “minor” premisses). E.g., man is a rational animal; but Socrates is a man; therefore Socrates is a rational animal. (Location 1300)
- syllogism is not a mechanism for the discovery of truth so much as for the clarification of exposition and thought. (Location 1310)
#### IV. The Organization of Science
##### 1. GREEK SCIENCE BEFORE ARISTOTLE
- 9The most important of the dialogues are: The Apology of Socrates, Crito, Phædo, The Symposium, Phædrus, Gorgias, Parmenides, and The Statesman. The most important parts of The Republic (references are to marginally-numbered sections, not to pages) are 327–32, 336–77, 384–5, 392–426, 433–5, 441–76, 481–3, 512–20, 572–94. The best edition is Jowett’s; the most convenient is in the Everyman series. References are to The Republic unless otherwise stated. (Location 9602)
- 11The reader who wishes to go to the philosopher himself will find the Meteorology an interesting example of Aristotle’s scientific work; he will derive much practical instruction from the Rhetoric; and he will find Aristotle at his best in books i-ii of the Ethics, and books i–iv of the Politics. The best translation of the Ethics is Welldon’s; of the Politics, Jowett’s. Sir Alexander Grant’s Aristotle is a simple book; Zeller’s Aristotle (vols. iii–iv in his Greek Philosophy) is scholarly but dry; Gomprez’s Greek Thinkers (vol. iv) is masterly but difficult. (Location 9643)
