- Full Title: Opinion | the Children of Pornhub
- URL: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/opinion/sunday/pornhub-rape-trafficking.html

## Highlights
- Pornhub is owned by Mindgeek, a private pornography conglomerate with more than 100 websites, production companies and brands. Its sites include Redtube, Youporn, XTube, SpankWire, ExtremeTube, Men.com, My Dirty Hobby, Thumbzilla, PornMD, Brazzers and GayTube. There are other major players in porn outside the Mindgeek umbrella, most notably XHamster and XVideos, but Mindgeek is a porn titan. If it operated in another industry, the Justice Department could be discussing an antitrust case against it.
    - Note: Porhnub alone gets more view than Netflix, Yahoo or Amazon. Can't imagine how many views does this group gets altogether.
