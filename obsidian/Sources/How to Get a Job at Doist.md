## Highlights
- The bare minimum is a top-notch cover letter.
- I wish more would set aside the time to write personalized cover letters. Too many only attach a resume which disqualifies them instantly.
- Absolutely, it’s a big plus if you have a personal side project of any kind. It demonstrates you’re willing to invest time and energy in things that don’t necessarily pay off monetarily, but you do it out of passion or love to something.
- Generally, the process looks like this. - Initial interview with someone you’d be working closely with at Doist- Complete a test task- Interview with Head of the team you’d be joining - Interview with me to screen for cultural and personal fit
