## Highlights
- But this book is not written in the usual way. It is written using an external thinking system, which I call a Second Brain.
  The evidence is clear: Instead of squeezing as many pages as possible out of one idea, How To Take Smart Notes squeezes as many ideas as possible onto every page. Every paragraph has a point, and I struggled to leave anything out of this summary
- Principle #1: Writing is not the outcome of thinking; it is the medium in which thinking takes place
- Writing is not only for proclaiming fully formed opinions, but for developing opinions worth sharing in the first place. 
- The problem is that the meaning of something is not always obvious. It requires elaboration – we need to copy, translate, re-write, compare, contrast, and describe a new idea in our own terms. We have to view the idea from multiple perspectives and answer questions such as “How does this fact fit with others I already know?” and “How can this phenomenon be explained by that theory?” or “How does this argument compare to that one?”
  Completing these tasks is exceedingly difficult inside the confines of our heads. We need an external medium in which to perform this elaboration, and writing is the most effective and convenient one ever invented. 
- Principle #2: Do your work as if writing is the only thing that matters
