## Metadata
- Author: [[Shawn Wang]]
- Full Title: The Coding Career Handbook

## Highlights
### Chapter 1 Part I: Your Coding Career
#### 1.1 Principles over Titles
#### 1.2 Company Types
- It’s important to learn what kind of environment you thrive in - finding your best fit is going to be more rewarding for your career in the long-term than chasing pay or prestige in the short-term. (Location 610)
    - Note: Startup, corp, freelance
#### 1.3 Career Layers
- The OSI Model provides a mental framework for how different technologies like HTTP, TCP, IP, and 802.11 come together, each solving their assigned problems, and (for the most part) seamlessly interoperating (with the help of some Narrow Waists). (Location 618)
    - Tags: [[tolearn]] 
#### 1.4 Diversity
#### 1.5 The Five Career Stages
### Chapter 2 Code Newbies
### Chapter 3 The (First) Job Hunt
### Chapter 4 Junior Developer
#### 4.1 Finding Your Groove
- A powerful and subtle way of asking for help is asking to pair program with your mentors and peers.  It may feel awkward at first, but there are always subtle tips and tricks to pick up from closely watching how your coworkers solve problems, and they can understand where you make mistakes and give more context than normally available in a code review. (Location 1162)
- Take some time to learn how to use a debugger.  Debuggers are quite beneficial when navigating new, undocumented or poorly documented codebases, or to debug weird issues. (Location 1183)
- A few developers fall prey to the opposite problem - instead of lacking confidence, they assume too much confidence.  The Dunning-Kruger effect is real - remember that you don’t know what you don’t know. (Location 1194)
#### 4.2 Making Mistakes
#### 4.3 Adding Value
- As long as you’ve got your basic responsibilities down, you’re going to want to say yes to whatever comes your way.  If you bite off more than you can chew, it is your manager/team’s responsibility to help you out, or to step in if things are going south. (Location 1245)
- do good work with the stuff you have committed to.  Your personal brand is ultimately the work that you do. (Location 1248)
- You might feel intimidated at doing things beyond your comfort zone, but you’re going to have to get good at it to grow. (Location 1249)
#### 4.4 Growing Your Knowledge
- You really only know when you have learned anything when you can teach what you learn. (Location 1319)
- In the process of writing and speaking, you will discover things you thought you knew but really didn’t, but also assemble a concentrated useful resource of everything you know about a particular topic, that you can (and will!)  pull up in future. (Location 1320)
- Do talks.  Speaking forces you to have skin in the game.  Any embarrassment that results is only temporary - in fact it will drive you to be better.  Worried that your talk will suck?  Don’t worry - it will!  Everyone has some amount of bad talks in them.  Better to get them out earlier (when it doesn’t matter) than later (when you don’t have a choice). (Location 1327)
- One way to get ideas for blogposts and to learn faster than you can alone, is to answer other people’s questions.  There are an unlimited number of people looking for help on StackOverflow, Twitter, Reddit, and in GitHub issues. (Location 1344)
- “When one teaches, two learn.”  - Robert Heinlein (Location 1352)
    - Tags: [[quote]] 
- All of this learning in public will also help you build your network.  The benefits from your network compound over time, so you might as well start early. (Location 1353)
### Chapter 5 From Junior to Senior
#### 5.1 Acting For the Job You Want
##### 5.1.1 Technical Expertise
- Much of your learning from Junior to Senior involves gaining tacit knowledge.  You can read all the programming books in the world, but, by definition, you are still limited to things that people can write down.  That is explicit knowledge, and it is usually the tip of the iceberg when it comes to everything you need to know: Tacit knowledge in engineering is a real thing.  Keep a look out for all the lessons you don’t learn in classes or from books.  To really make your career explode, make a habit of writing them down for everyone else (Chapter 18 - Write, A Lot!). (Location 1400)
##### 5.1.2 Career Strategy
- By the way - beyond just what you like to work on, you might also take note of who you like to work with. (Location 1430)
#### 5.2 Marketing Yourself as a Senior Engineer
- People crossing from Junior to Senior are particularly likely to be at or just coming out of the “Valley of Despair”. (Location 1441)
- In particular, anything you do in public - blogging, speaking, podcasting, making video tutorials, open source work - can help you grow your knowledge and your network at the same time, opening up the possibility for inbound opportunities to come to you.  Remember to fight Impostor Syndrome every step of the way! (Location 1456)
#### 5.3 Junior Engineer, Senior Engineer
##### 5.3.1 Code
##### 5.3.2 Learning
- Juniors make one-off side projects.  Seniors use their side projects daily, often to make themselves more productive at their day job. (Location 1485)
##### 5.3.3 Behavior
##### 5.3.4 Team
#### 5.4 To Stay or To Go
### Chapter 6 Senior Developer
#### 7.1 Engineering Management
#### 7.2 Product Management
#### 7.3 Developer Relations
#### 7.4 Developer Education
#### 7.5 Entrepreneurship
- David Ogilvy once observed: “The problem with market research is that people don’t think how they feel, they don’t say what they think and they don’t do what they say”. (Location 2259)

### Chapter 8 Part II: Principles
- Principles are ways of successfully dealing with reality to get what you want out of life.  - Ray Dalio (Location 2352)
    - Tags: [[q]] 
### Chapter 9 Learn in Public
#### 9.1 Private vs Public
#### 9.2 Getting Started
- by far the biggest beneficiary of you helping past you, will be future you.  If (when) others benefit, that’s icing on the cake. (Location 2439)
- When you have no following and no personal brand, you also have no expectations weighing you down.  You can experiment with different formats, different domains. (Location 2442)
#### 9.3 But I’m Scared
#### 9.4 Teach to Learn
- “If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.”  - Albert Einstein (Location 2474)
    - Tags: [[q]] 
#### 9.5 Mentors, Mentees, and Becoming an Expert
#### 9.6 Appendix: Why It Works
- Cunningham’s Law: “The best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question; it’s to post the wrong answer.”  Being publicly wrong attracts teachers, (Location 2513)
#### 9.7 Appendix: Intellectual History
### Chapter 10 Clone Open Source Apps
- Resist the urge to make your special snowflake (for now).  Oh but then who would use yet another Hacker News clone?  I’ve got news for you: No one was gonna use your thing anyway.  You’re practicing coding, not making a startup.  Remember? (Location 2570)
- You don’t even have to work on apps, if you want you can build your own clones of popular libraries and frameworks.  Daniel Stefanovic’s Build Your Own X repo is a treasure trove of tutorials for these if you need help. (Location 2604)
- Package up your experience into a talk.  Livestream yourself coding.  Blog about your game plan, then blog some more as you execute it.  Developers who can Work in Public are in far more demand than developers who can’t. (Location 2625)
### Chapter 11 Know Your Tools
- You are scared to make changes to your config because it blows up when you so much as look at it. (Location 2636)
    - Note: saving this as i can strongly relate :)
#### 11.1 Avoid FOMO
- Vue passed React in Github stars, should you pivot to Vue?  I dunno, do you get paid in Github stars? (Location 2651)
    - Tags: [[funny]] 
#### 11.2 Beyond the Tool
- Compared to other academic pursuits, there could not be an easier subject matter to research, this stuff is literally all online and version controlled with git, and all the people involved are still alive and easily contactable. And when you’ve filled something in, when you’ve found something cool in your research, write it up.  Preferably in public! (Location 2695)
### Chapter 12 Specialize in the New
#### 12.1 Technology Complements
- Focus right next to where others are investing heavily. (Location 2735)
#### Plant your flag on fertile ground, and say, “this is what I do”.  It will carry you far.
- 12.2 Lindy Compounding (Location 2752)
### Chapter 13 Open Source Your Knowledge
- What happened to Code is happening to Knowledge. (Location 2799)
#### 13.1 Open Knowledge
#### 13.2 Open Source Knowledge
#### 13.3 Personal Anecdote
- The “README in a Git Repo” thing isn’t the only way to do Open Source Knowledge, but it is a damn good one. (Location 2848)
#### 13.4 Why Open Source YOUR Knowledge
#### 13.5 Tips
- Optimize for Copy and Paste - the most immediate value you can provide to yourself and others is to offer copy-and-pasteable examples.  Make the examples clearly self-contained, well annotated, and made for Copy and Paste. (Location 2882)
- The world punishes the vague wish and rewards the Specific Ask. (Location 2899)
### Chapter 14 Spark Joy
#### 14.1 What is Sparking Joy?
#### 14.2 Why It Works
- In the same way, you should want your work to stand out in the memory of everyone from your colleagues to your potential customers.  Because you’ve given them something remarkable to hinge on, they can then become your biggest advocates. (Location 2931)
- Sparking Joy isn’t just about standing out, though: so long as your work evokes good vibes with people, they’ll associate you with positive emotions. (Location 2933)
#### 14.3 Examples
##### 14.3.1 Sparking Joy in Code
- Comments explain why, Code explains the how.  - Jem Young (Location 2961)
- Instead of explaining what the code is doing, which is often evident from just reading the code itself and liable to go out of date when code is changed, you can try to note why some choices were made, or why the “obvious” approach wasn’t chosen, or give an ASCII art diagram of how the code works.  When you anticipate what I’m going to ask as I read your code, believe me, that Sparks Joy. (Location 2967)
    - Note: I like the idea of Ascii img in codw
- According to Sarah Drasner (elaborated in talk form here), comments can serve these other good purposes as well: Clarifying something that is not legible by regular human beings Break up chunks of code, like chapters of a book Pseudocode to keep the logic straight while writing the code Indicating TODOs or what parts of code are OK to refactor Serving as a teaching tool to fellow teammates Admitting where you got it from StackOverflow (Location 2973)
- A normal error message tells you an error happened somewhere.  A good error message tells you the local state that caused the error.  A great error message tells you probable causes and how to fix it.  A terrible error design doesn’t show up at all - a silent error. (Location 2994)
- To Spark Joy, we look for opportunities to go above and beyond.  One way to be a developer that others enjoy working with is to write code others enjoy reading and using. (Location 3010)
##### 14.3.2 Sparking Joy in PRs and Issues
- Simply doing what you say you are going to do sparks joy. (Location 3030)
- The most high impact way a developer can spark joy is in writing good docs.  It is the first thing every new user and team-mate reads, and shows that you care about the project. (Location 3041)
- Get straight to the point.  Place Installation, Examples, and API docs up front and use a Table of Contents generator to make it easy to navigate. (Location 3045)
- CI Badges are associated with quality.  It’s tempting to regard docs badges as performative “pieces of flair”, but an academic study of this phenomenon has actually found that badges with underlying analyses, e.g.  displaying build status, issue resolution times, and code coverage are predictive of project quality. (Location 3063)
- Shields.io makes it easy to set up a selection of great badges. (Location 3066)
- READMEs are typically written in Markdown, which imposes some strict order on your content, but you can often break that monotony by using some HTML alignment with <div align="center">, or adding a logo or banner (either ask for contributions or use a generator like Hipster Logo Generator, Hatchful, or Excalidraw). (Location 3074)
- With GitHub-flavored Markdown, you can even hide lengthy explanations of edge cases in HTML <details> and <summary> tags interspersed with Markdown, which helps make your docs useful for both the skimmer and the dev who wants to dig deeper. (Location 3082)
- Automate formatting for your docs.  You can run prettier as a git hook (with husky and pretty-quick for a fast experience), and use doctoc to keep your Table of Contents up to date (also available as a GitHub action). (Location 3085)
- Sometimes a picture speaks a thousand words.  Feature screenshots or a demo gif if possible.  For “How it Works” sections, you can also create simple ASCII diagrams using tools like ASCII Flow and Monodraw to explain systems and concepts.  You can even use free drawing tools like Excalidraw, Draw.io (in VS Code too!)  and Miro to illustrate with color. (Location 3091)
##### 14.3.4 Sparking Joy in Demos and Products
- Even when you are demonstrating how to interact with an API, you can use joke APIs like this one for “clean” jokes or this one for developer jokes or this one for devops jokes.  If you need to be more serious, check Public API Lists for interesting APIs you can demo with. (Location 3114)
- For apps like Superhuman, the empty state is not only a goal, it is a competitive advantage.  Check emptystat.es for more inspiration in real apps. (Location 3150)
#### 14.4 The Extra Mile
- Your capacity to inspire joy is only limited by your creativity.  But people always notice when you do.  Going the extra mile to delight people invokes the principle of reciprocity, which is one of the most powerful forms of influence. (Location 3201)
### Chapter 15 The Platinum Rule
