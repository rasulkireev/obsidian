## Highlights
- You can consult the "all of the fonts you'll ever need" cheat sheet I sent you when you enrolled in the course, or here's a few other recommendations: 
  Georgia for a sophisticated serif
  Helvetica for a clean and neutral design
  Lato for a friendly and "natural" look
  Raleway for a more modern geometric look
