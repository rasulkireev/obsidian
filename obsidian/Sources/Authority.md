- Full Title: Authority

## Highlights
- Plenty of people had explored the roads to the East long before Marco Polo. In fact, Marco’s father and uncle had made their exploratory trips well before Marco was born. So why does Marco get all the credit? Why is he the one we remember and name silly games after? Simple. He wrote about it. (Location 20)

- You can continue to create cutting-edge work and strive to be the best in your industry, but until you start teaching and sharing, your reach and influence will be limited. (Location 27)

- You don’t have to be an expert to teach. Even if you are learning a new skill or topic, you can still teach it. Chances are someone will always know less about it than you do. (Location 91)
- But to get people to pay the prices needed to be really successful, it’s best if they will use your training to make considerably more money than they spent. (Location 132)
- Competition shows that there is a market. Embrace competition. See it as a good thing. There is plenty of room for everyone. (Location 145)
- But just because someone else spent thousands of hours on their life’s work, doesn’t mean you need to do that for your first book. (Location 206)
- I made more money with a single $2.99 eBook than most startups do over their whole lifetime. This is especially clear for me since  at the same time I was also working on my own startup, Folyo, which never made anything close to the book's numbers.  The lesson for me is that the revenue potential of digital products in general (books, fonts, icons, etc.) is probably underestimated compared to the SaaS model that most startups favor.

- While I’m never quite that bad, poor posture has started to become a problem for me. Not good. A great solution for me has been to stand as I write. In fact, I’m standing right now. (Location 502)
- As you write your book, keep learning. In fact, never stop learning. There will always be someone who knows more on the topic than you do. Learn from them. Cite them in your book, read the source materials they learned from, and use their work to inspire you to make yours even better. (Location 521)
- Deliver tons of value and charge based on that. (Location 660)
- Here are a few examples of different media you could try with your product: Short video tips Video Interviews Text interviews Design resources Sample code Explanation screencasts Video lessons (video of the expert talking) Photoshop files (Location 710)
- The labels you use to describe your products are important. You may think since it’s just text content, it doesn’t matter what you call it. But it turns out guides or courses are perceived to be more valuable than books. After (Location 782)
- Courses, guides, kits, lessons, and classes are worth far more than books. (Location 793)
- That feedback is incredibly valuable, but I didn’t get it until I actually asked for money. (Location 808)

- Don’t trust someone’s opinion as validation. Only trust their money. (Location 811)
- The publishing company Five Simple Steps uses very simple covers for all of their books. A solid color and good typography are enough to add credibility to their books. (Location 960)
- Finally, on each of my book covers I add a simple background pattern. Acquired from SubtlePatterns.com, these patterns just add a bit more detail. For Authority I used a collection of random typographic characters. You can choose from hundreds of patterns; just make sure you keep the end result subtle. It’s really easy to overdo the design.

- Now that we’ve covered the high-level strategy, actually landing the guest posts comes down to quality content and relationships. The more people you know, the easier this is. Start by making a list of sites you would like to guest post on (it helps if you already read those sites), then make a list of the writer or editor for each one. If you have time, start building up a relationship slowly. Start by leaving helpful comments on their blog posts and starting small conversations on Twitter. Then after they have seen your name come up a few times, send a helpful email. A great option is to link to another post you think they will find interesting. (Location 1126)
- Don’t just email them a copy of the book. First send a very short email explaining who you are and the project you are working on. Ask if they would be interested in a review copy. Make sure they understand you don’t expect anything from them. If they are busy they can look it over and ignore it. Then if they respond positively, send over the content. Your results will improve significantly. The less you ask of them the easier it is to get a buy in. Once you have that soft commitment from them they will be much more likely to actually help you.

- When Tim Ferriss (whom no one had heard of at the time) tried to get bloggers to review his first book, The 4-Hour Work Week, he didn’t send them the entire thing. Instead he found one chapter that he thought his target would find particularly interesting and sent them only that.  One chapter or section is a lot less intimidating to read than the entire book. Since he targeted his content and his pitch to each person individually, his results improved significantly. (Location 1183)
- Now about those testimonials. If you want them, you need to ask. It’s really rare that busy people will volunteer good testimonials about your work. In the publishing world it is very common for authors to write endorsements for each other’s books. (Location 1187)
