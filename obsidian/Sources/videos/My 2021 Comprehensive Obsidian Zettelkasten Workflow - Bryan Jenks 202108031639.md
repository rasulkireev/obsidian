## What is your [[Goals|goal]]?
- you need to have a [[Goals|goal]] in mind to go towards
	- Article, Book, Academic Paper, Video Script, etc.
	- sure it is fine to take random notes, perhaps Journaling, and other things, but the best thing you can for your [[Zettelkasten]] is to have a goal and work towards it.

## [[Quick Capture]]
- Figure out a way to quickly capture thoughts and ideas. Perhaps, through the [[Daily Notes]], [[Evergreen notes]], or some other structured way 👇
- > note: add a folder for quick capture / inbox, where I could put anything random that comes to mind. Or, maybe just add a subheading to the [[Daily Notes]] page named [[Random]]

## [[Status Tracking]]
- After you've added a note via quick capture have you processed it as necessary, AKA moved from [[Inbox]] to appropriate place, with appropriate [[Tagging|tags]], etc.
	- perhaps each note template should have a [[Status]] attribute...

## [[Search]] and [[Filter]]
- the good thing is that since we are working with regular text, searching can  be done easily via tools that have existed for a long long time now
- examples of [[Cataloging]] and Systems for [[Textual Search]]
	- [[Cutter Classification System]]
	- [[Special Symbol Taxonomy]]
