# Adding Data to a Template
![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article2.74d541386bbf.png)

## Metadata
- Author: [[spookylukey.github.io]]
- Full Title: Adding Data to a Template
- URL: https://spookylukey.github.io/django-views-the-right-way/context-data.html

## Highlights
- Here is another blog post about putting data on your home page. The author’s first attempt involved using
  template tags to solve this problem — something he was very embarrassed about.
  But he shouldn’t be embarrassed — for a newbie, you would have to be a pretty
  capable developer to actually successfully pull off all the parts needed for a
  custom template tag.
  Rather, he struggled for so long because of a bad starting point that was making a simple thing hard. If we as the Django
  community have made this hard, we are the ones who should be embarrassed.
    - Note: This brings tears to my eyes... 
      Author talks about me here, end calls me a pretty capable developer.
