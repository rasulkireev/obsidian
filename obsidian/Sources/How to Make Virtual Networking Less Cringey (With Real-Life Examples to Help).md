## Highlights
- The problem is, the same technology that makes it easy for you to reach out makes it easy for everyone else to reach out too. How do you stand out in crowded inboxes and noisy timelines?
    - Note: That's true with any advancement in technology, they are usually available to everyone. Those who learn to use it best are the ones that get ahead.
- taking a couple of hours at the start to get clear on why you’re networking and the value you can provide to the people you want to connect with will save you—and the people you’re reaching out to—a lot of time.
- without a filter for who you want to connect with and why, you’ll end wasting a lot of time—yours and others
- Once you know why you’re networking, you can start building a profile of who you should be connecting with.
- Make it a habit to save interesting people, companies, and opportunities you come across to come back to later.
    - Note: There are multitude of web browser extensions that can help you do that. Better than todoist for this purpose is probably Joplin or Notion.
- Get clear on the value you provide and get comfortable communicating it
    - Note: The first thing you want to think about is how you can help them, and only then how they can help you.
- Be sure you can tell a simple story about who you are, what you do, and the value you can provide.
    - Note: One / two sentences:
      - I’m a management consultant who helps big corporations make the shift to remote work.
      - I’m a design student looking for a junior product design role at a mid-size SaaS company that values good UI/UX design.
      - I’m a content marketer looking to learn from the experiences of other content marketers and share mine in return
- You can have all of the connections in the world, but if they don’t know your story, what you’re looking to accomplish, and the value you can provide, they won’t be able to help you. And if they’ve taken the time to talk to you, they want to help you.
- Here are some examples of ways you can network generously:Connect others to job listings or freelance opportunities—when you help a great candidate find a great company you’re doing both sides a favorRecommend them for a panel or a source for an articleContribute to open source communitiesShare free design templates or tools for apps like Figma and ProcreateShare your experience when they ask a question on social mediaAmplify their work and social media postsMake introductions to others’ in your networkFeature them in a blog post you’re writing or podcast you hostSend them an article, book, video, or other resource you know they’d find interesting or helpfulLet them know the impact they’ve had on you—it makes people feel good to know they’ve helped someone
- If the person has an email newsletter, replying to the newsletter is often a warmer approach than reaching out with no context at all.
- Expressing appreciation for something the person wrote or said that resonated with you is another great way to personalize your message.
- Include a clear request for them to respond to
- If you don’t hear back, follow up. It’s not rude or pushy to follow up! Give it two weeks to two months.
- You won’t be able to maintain relationships with everyone you connect with, but be sure to reconnect periodically with the people you do want to stay in touch with.
    - Note: - Send a link to something that made you think of them
      - Highlight something they wrote recently that you appreciated
      - Recommend a product you’ve found that you think they’d find helpful or a company or conference you think they’d find interesting
      - Give them an update on your career—if someone’s advice and an introduction they made helped you out, tell them!
