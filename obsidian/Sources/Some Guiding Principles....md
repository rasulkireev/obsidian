## Highlights
- Be in alignment with what’s most important to you (your values).
- Do not change because of what others want, change because of what you want.
- Don't be influenced by your fear of the consequences.
- Your decisions are meant to empower others, not control them.
- Honor people where they are, not where you want them to be.
- Make decisions based on who you are and want to be, not who you were.
- Fulfil your needs first so you have enough to give to others.
- When someone triggers you, focus on healing yourself, not changing them.
- What you want is just as important as what other people want.

- You don’t have to wear your emotional armor all the time.

- Contribute to your own happiness and unhappiness because of the paths you choose and the people you choose to be with.
- Understand that you can create unhealthy relationships by seeking in others what’s missing in you.
- It is not someone else’s job to make you happy.
