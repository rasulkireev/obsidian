## Lesson 1. The Roam Note Taking Paradigm

- Sounds like Roam, does not allow to create folder structure. Having a little [[OCD]] I feel like having this functionality in [[Obsidian]] is nice. However, that could be more annoying to keep tidy. Will see. 
- Even though Nat is planning to add Obsidian related videos in the future, I will try to follow the Roam stuff with Obsidian in mind.


## Lesson 2. Starting Your Roam Journey with the Daily Note

- Should be used as a cross between
	-  inbox 📥  can include:
		-  [[Journaling]] / [[Morning Journaling]]
		-  [[Idea | Ideas]]
		-  [[Reminder]]
		-  [[Daily Plan]]
		-  [[Meeting]] Notes
	-  notebook 📓can include:
		-  [[Task]]
		-  [[Articles to Read]]

**Side note**: As I'm going through the course, and while reading some forums today, I have decided to try adding more personal stuff into my [[Zettelkasten]] starting with [[Daily Notes]]. The main reason for that is the idea that we as [[Humans]] are very bad at predicting what will be important to us in the future. By keeping everything in one system, it is more likely that I will keep that "special something" that my future self will enjoy close and available. This means I have to decide what to do with my [[Joplin]] library... I do have some sentimental attachment to this piece of software, so it will be hard to let go. Although, I'm not sure that is what I will do.
