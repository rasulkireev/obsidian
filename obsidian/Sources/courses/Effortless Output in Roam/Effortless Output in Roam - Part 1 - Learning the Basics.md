## 1. The Roam Note Taking Paradigm

- Sounds like Roam, does not allow to create folder structure. Having a little [[OCD]] I feel like having this functionality in [[Obsidian]] is nice. However, that could be more annoying to keep tidy. Will see. 
- Even though Nat is planning to add Obsidian related videos in the future, I will try to follow the Roam stuff with Obsidian in mind.


## 2. Starting Your Roam Journey with the Daily Note

- Should be used as a cross between
	-  inbox 📥  can include:
		-  [[Journaling]] / [[Morning Journaling]]
		-  [[Idea | Ideas]]
		-  [[Reminder]]
		-  [[Daily Plan]]
		-  [[Meeting]] Notes
	-  notebook 📓can include:
		-  [[Task]]
		-  [[Articles to Read]]

**Side note**: As I'm going through the course, and while reading some forums today, I have decided to try adding more personal stuff into my [[Zettelkasten]] starting with [[Daily Notes]]. The main reason for that is the idea that we as [[Humans]] are very bad at predicting what will be important to us in the future. By keeping everything in one system, it is more likely that I will keep that "special something" that my future self will enjoy close and available. This means I have to decide what to do with my [[Joplin]] library... I do have some sentimental attachment to this piece of software, so it will be hard to let go. Although, I'm not sure that is what I will do.

## 3. Creating Your First New Pages
- basics

## 4. The Four Ways to Link Between Pages
- This is slightly different in [[Roam Research]] and [[Obsidian]]. In Roam you # tag and [[]] links are essentially the same, whereas here it is slightly different.
- :: syntax is pretty cool. Author:: smith is the same as each of these words are in double square brackets.
- Essentially all these are for visual differences, no functional difference.
## 5. Increasing Your Roam Productivity with the Sidebar
- this is probably more Roam specific, and can be easily replaced by [[Alfred]] Snippets.
- Actually [[Andy Matuschak]] mode allows for editing two notes at the same time, or write on one and reference the other.

## 6. Using Filters to Search Your Growing Database
-
## 7. ToDos and Task Management
-
## 8.  Referencing and Embedding Info from Other Pages
- In order to preserve the source an to use info on different pages use the embedded. In obsidian, it would be a ![[]] syntax.
	- For example, Nat has many different pages that somehow relate to Sourdough. Then he creates a page "Baking Sourdough Bread" (like a small project, or a blog post preparation) and pulls relevant info onto that page. and if the source is ever changed, it will propogate to the blog post page.
