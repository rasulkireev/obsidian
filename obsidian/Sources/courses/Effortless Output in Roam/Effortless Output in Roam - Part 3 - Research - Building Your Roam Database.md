## 1.   Intro to Research and Metadata in Roam
-  Tags & Metadata are useful... 
-  Ideas for Metadata for different types of notes [(link)](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/RoamTutorial/page/tD-eEH4W3)
-  While doing this I'm now thinking that the way to go is probably to manually pull all highlights from [[Readwise]] and paste them in a single document, then as time allow separate them into separate [[Evergreen notes]]. Here is the list of [[Books to Review | books I need to review]] and will be good for this Experiment.

## 2. Using Readwise with Roam

## 3. Adding Article Notes to Roam
- Essentially, Nat goes through the same process, but he doesn't bother creating separate notes with single ideas (at least at this part of the course). So he has a page for the article and moves all the notes there, doing a bunch of tags. I wonder if he is going to separate them in smaller evergreen notes. Will see.
- Actually, I don't do this enough. I move evergreen notes from [[Notion]] to [[Obsidian]], but never leave all the notes under the article/book page.
