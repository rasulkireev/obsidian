## 1.   Intro to Research and Metadata in Roam
-  Tags & Metadata are useful... 
-  Ideas for Metadata for different types of notes [(link)](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/RoamTutorial/page/tD-eEH4W3)
-  While doing this I'm now thinking that the way to go is probably to manually pull all highlights from [[Readwise]] and paste them in a single document, then as time allow separate them into separate [[Evergreen notes]]. Here is the list of [[Books to Review | books I need to review]] and will be good for this Experiment. ^78bcd7

## 2. Using Readwise with Roam

## 3. Adding Article Notes to Roam
- Essentially, Nat goes through the same process, but he doesn't bother creating separate notes with single ideas (at least at this part of the course). So he has a page for the article and moves all the notes there, doing a bunch of tags. I wonder if he is going to separate them in smaller evergreen notes. Will see.
- Actually, I don't do this enough. I move evergreen notes from [[Notion]] to [[Obsidian]], but never leave all the notes under the article/book page.

## 4. Adding Book Notes to Roam
- As I said, I realize that a lot of things that Nat is doing, I already do (at least at that point), at least when it comes to note capture. So, what I can't wait to find out is how he uses such information...
- One thing that differs is that Nat (in that course at least) takes notes on material that he needs for a project/capstone, so it kind of makes sense how he uses it. I would love to find out if he ever comes up with material from notes taken randomly.

## 5. Saving Tweets in Roam
- Manual link import and [[Readwise]] integration.

## 6. Annotating Videos in Roam
- Embedding YouTube video in Roam and then taking under the embedding.

## 7. Saving Podcast Highlights in Roam
- Use [[Airr]]. It also integrate with [[Readwise]]

## 8. Storing Webpage Highlights in Roam
- Use [[hypothes.is]], which also happens to integrate with [[Readwise]]

## 9. Using Roam on the Go
- When it comes to [[Obsidian]], they just introduced a mobile app, that works on both [[iOS]] and [[Android]]. It actually works better on [[Android]] as the sync with Dropbox works much better.

## 10. Research Outro
- If working on the Capstone, then take some time and actually populate your database. This will make it much easier to go through the next steps of the course.
