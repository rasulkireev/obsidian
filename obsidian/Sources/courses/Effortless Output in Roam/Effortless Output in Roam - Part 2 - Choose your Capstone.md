## 1. Choose Your Capstone
- [[Research]] driver
- Topic you're interested in
- Can turn into a deliverable
- Scope that can be completed in 5-6 weeks

### Ideas
- An area of interest
- A project to scope out
- A deliverable for work
- Something on your "someday maybe" list you
keep putting off
- Question: What is it you want to explore?
- Deliverable: What will you create from
exploring that topic?

So, the main idea here is to actually create something. I'm exploring my ideas in [[Capston Ideas for Effortless Output in Roam course | this document]].
