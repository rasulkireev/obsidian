## 1. Choose Your Capstone
- [[Research]] driver
- Topic you're interested in
- Can turn into a deliverable
- Scope that can be completed in 5-6 weeks

### Ideas
- An area of interest
- A project to scope out
- A deliverable for work
- Something on your "someday maybe" list you
keep putting off
- Question: What is it you want to explore?
- Deliverable: What will you create from
exploring that topic?

So, the main idea here is to actually create something. I'm exploring my ideas in [[Capstone Ideas for Effortless Output in Roam course | this document]].

I have a couple of cool projects going on and don't want to do a Capstone right now. What I do want is to learn of good ways to build my digital brain using the Zettelkasten method. Or rather, how Nat does his. I will keep a [[Capstone Ideas for Effortless Output in Roam course| list of potential Capstone projects]] that I will do, but for know I will focus on building my database, that I will use extensively in the close future.

So, I will just continue to the [[Effortless Output in Roam - Part 3 - Research - Building Your Roam Database | part 3]] of the course.
