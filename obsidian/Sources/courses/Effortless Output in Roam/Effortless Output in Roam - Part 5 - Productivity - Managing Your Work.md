## 1. Intro to [[Productivity]] in [[Roam Research]] - [[Getting Things Done]]

## 2. Creating Your First Projects
- Use Project Metadata on each project, which will obviously have it's own page. Like, [[Review of Doing Time Right]] for example.
- Status can be active, completed, someday, someday/maybe, archived
- Project need to have a success criteria (i.e. finish and publish the article), otherwise it is an [[Area of Responsibility]].
- Some categories that are useful to have:
	- [[Overview]]: reminder where I am and what needs to be done next (evolves as project is moving along)
	- [[Resources]]: page links and things that you might need to reference to complete the project.
		- You could go to each Tag to the project and see what [[Backlinks]] to that topic. All of that can contribute to the project.
	- [[Project Plan]] is a list of todos, look at [[#^a3f0aa | next section]]...

## 3. Using [[Queries]] to Dynamically Build Your Projects

^a3f0aa

Examples:
- display pages with two (queried) links
	- can add not something
	- so any boolean logic for tags and links 
- search for todos that are related to a tag

		```query
		content:[[Productivity]] AND task-todo: ""
		```
- When you are creating those tasks you can add a date next to them as to when you want to complete them. That way those tasks will show up in your [[Daily Notes]]

## 4. [[Project Management| Managing Different Projects]]
- Important to [[Tag]] you project with `[[projects]]` so that you have a projects page with all the things you are working on. (or maybe a `#project` is better since it is kind of a description tag... )
- when [[Tagging]] a project, also think about other descriptive tags, like: active/done/archived, personal/work, writing/coding, etc.
	- if those descriptions can be put into a category, than it is worth putting it under separate attribute like `Status: active` (could be put into [[Frontmatter]])

## 5. Weekly [[Planning]] in Roam
- take some time each Monday/Sunday to plan the week ahead. This can be done in the "Weekly Plan for  8/31" page where the date is the start of the week (ie Monday). [[Weekly Plan Template]]
- The idea is to look at pre-existing [[Queries]] and pull them into the [[Weekly Plan Template| Weekly Plan]].

## 6. The [[daily | Daily Productivity Dashboard]]
-  If you are putting dates next to your tasks, then they should automatically show up on you daily notes page. blow is an example of a todo that will show up on the [[Daily Notes|Daily Note]].
	-  [x] example todo [[2021-08-03]]
- the section for top priorities is a little hazy and I need to experiment with it at some point. Don't think it is urgent, as I won't have too many tasks to start with. Although, that might change soon.
