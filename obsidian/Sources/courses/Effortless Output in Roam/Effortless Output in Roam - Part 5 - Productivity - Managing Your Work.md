## 1. Intro to [[Productivity]] in [[Roam Research]] - [[Getting Things Done]]

## 2. Creating Your First Projects
- Use Project Metadata on each project, which will obviously have it's own page. Like, [[Review of Doing Time Right]] for example.
- Status can be active, completed, someday, someday/maybe, archived
- Project need to have a success criteria (i.e. finish and publish the article), otherwise it is an [[Area of Responsibility]].
- Some categories that are useful to have:
	- [[Overview]]: reminder where I am and what needs to be done next (evolves as project is moving along)
	- [[Resources]]: page links and things that you might need to reference to complete the project.
		- You could go to each Tag to the project and see what [[Backlinks]] to that topic. All of that can contribute to the project.
	- [[Project Plan]] is a list of todos, look at [[#^a3f0aa | next section]]...

## 3. Using [[Queries]] to Dynamically Build Your Projects

^a3f0aa

Examples:
- display pages with two (queried) links
	- can add not something
	- so any boolean logic for tags and links 
- search for todos that are related to a tag

		```query
		content:[[Productivity]] AND task-todo: ""
		```
- When you are creating those tasks you can add a date next to them as to when you want to complete them. That way those tasks will show up in your [[Daily Notes]]

## 4. Managing Different Projects
