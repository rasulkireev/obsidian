## 1. [[Morning Pages]] & [[Journaling]] in Roam
- Example -> [[2021-07-24]]

## 2. [[Recipe Management]] in Roam
- Look at the [[Metadata]] page for a good idea of what can be added and how to structure the page.
```
	- Tags: #Recipe
	- Ingredients:
	- Tools:
	- Source:
```

- By tagging ingredients you can then search recipes based on what you want to eat.
