## 1. Intro to Synthesis in Roam
- in this part we will focus on [[Making Notes Useful]]

## 2. (Managing) The Inbox
- One way to have an [[Inbox]] is by putting something in the [[Daily Notes]]
- The better way is to have a separate tag/page for inbox. Probably even tag.
- You can "Inbox" anything: a link, a parahraph, a task, etc. You can then look at tag list. This way is much easier to [[Search]]

## 3. Building Page Relationships with Tags
- First adding tags that seem relevant.
- Then going through the notes, linking everything that makes sense. For each new page created a task of "Research on this" is added. 
- Make sure to tag the project you are working on, as that will be the place where you can see all the relevant information.
