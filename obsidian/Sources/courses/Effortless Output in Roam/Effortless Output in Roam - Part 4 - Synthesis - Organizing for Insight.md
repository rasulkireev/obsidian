## 1. Intro to Synthesis in Roam
- in this part we will focus on [[Making Notes Useful]]

## 2. (Managing) The Inbox
- One way to have an [[Inbox]] is by putting something in the [[Daily Notes]]
- The better way is to have a separate tag/page for inbox. Probably even tag.
- You can "Inbox" anything: a link, a parahraph, a task, etc. You can then look at tag list. This way is much easier to [[Search]]

## 3. Building Page Relationships with Tags
- First adding tags that seem relevant.
- Then going through the notes, linking everything that makes sense. For each new page created a task of "Research on this" is added. 
- Make sure to tag the project you are working on, as that will be the place where you can see all the relevant information.

## 4. [[Progressive Summarization]] in Roam
- Idea developed by [[Tiago Forte]]
![[Effortless Output in Roam - Part 3 - Research - Building Your Roam Database#^78bcd7]]
- Step above is necessary to do [[Progressive Summarization]] in [[Obsidian]]
1. Start with [[Tagging]]
2. Then goes [[Bolding]]. Highlighting the information that jumps at you or you think is important.
3. [[Highlighting]]. Only highligting some of the thinks you bolded. This will help to pinpoint the most important parts, which ill be useful for quick reference.
4. Final step is [[Summarizing]]. You can take the most important info and write a quick summary about the topic idea. Can be written under Summary h3. This could be a paragraph or a bunch of points.
- this can conclude the inbox treatment.

## 5. Consolidating Your Knowledge into Head Pages
- All the collected info sits in different notes.
- Now we need to combine it into head pages. This is to dive deeper on major concepts of our [[Research]]
- Basically you go to the "[[Tagnote]]" page and start populating the info based on  the [[Backlinks]] you have added.
- You can split those tagnotes into separate sections:
	- Future Reading & Referencing (For anything you haven't done [[Progressive Summarization]] on)
	- Useful Material. Which is just the most useful things from the pages you have done [[Progressive Summarization]] on. So, [[Highlighting | Highlighted]] items. Or rather the bullets under the [[Summary]] heading (h3).
	- You can also create heading for related topics, that come from the backlinks.
- This strategy will help you have the most important things all in one place.
- You can obviously use [[Block Reference | block refs]]

## 6. Advanced References and Embeds
- In [[Roam Research]] you can edit the embed without going to the original page, and edits will propogate.
