## Highlights
- This is why usefulness is such a, well, useful thing to look for: it’s like walking through a junkyard for pieces of junk cars you can rip out and repurpose. You aren’t limited to the perspective or knowledge of the author. You start your own thinking at the level of the best thinking out there, instead of at ground level.
- Your second brain is not a factory where every piece has to flow through each layer, in sequence, on a strict timetable. It is a network — with local neighborhoods, city centers, and superhighways all changing in different ways, at different speeds, as it should be.
- Progressive Summarization is really a method for creating value in an environment of uncertainty. You do concrete, relatively easy work now instead of speculative, difficult work for later. You pull time-consuming, but risk-free activities (reading, highlighting, summarizing) as early in time as possible, and push quick but risky activities (execution, decision making, delivery) as far into the future as possible. This way, you have all the ammunition you need ready and waiting at a moment’s notice, while waiting until the eve of battle to decide which target to attack.
