## Highlights
- The bottom line is, you need to be strategic with the company you choose to join. Your time is valuable!

    - Note: When young work for companies that will teach you the hard/useful skills.
      Not only that, but companies also differ in how they conduct different projects and transitions between them.
      If situation permits, choose companies that will allow you to ask to work on different projects, try different skills.
- All in all, I left Twitter with an incredible breadth and depth of experience– having worked up and down the stack, in both existing codebases and greenfield projects, on my own and under the watchful eye of staff engineers.
    - Note: If you are working for the company that treats you well and you feel comfortable staying for a considerable amount of time, consider moving between teams to try different sides of engineering/programming.
      Specialized Generalists are in fashion now. It would also be cool for your growth to try different things. You will be closer to understanding your ideal job, and new skills will aid in other projects.
