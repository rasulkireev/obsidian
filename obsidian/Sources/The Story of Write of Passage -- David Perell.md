## Metadata
- Author: [[David Perell]]
- Full Title: The Story of Write of Passage — David Perell
- URL: https://www.perell.com/blog/story-of-write-of-passage

## Highlights
- If you want to build a business, build an audience first: I wrote online for 3.5 years before launching Write of Passage. In that time, my email list of almost 20,000 people has become my most important professional asset
- Build the product you wish existed: I’ve never done any market research for this course. Instead, I followed my intuition and built the course I wish existed when I began writing.
