## Highlights
- I’ll say it again - a shockingly small number of people have built their own thing on the internet.
- It’s a massive differentiator to have launched something. To have had an idea, and put it into the world.
  Even at Google I realized - most people I worked with had never actually put their own ideas out into the world. Everything they had worked on was a work project or a byproduct of their job.
