- By simply asking, “How do you say [sentence] in your language? Would you mind writing that down?” I can uncover the soul of a language and estimate how long it would take me to learn it. Pictures A and B, below, tell the story of a Ukrainian woman who taught me Cyrillic in 30 minutes, and the whole conversation was two hours long. Here are the 12 sentences, the “Deconstruction Dozen”: The apple is red. It is John’s apple. I give John the apple. We give him the apple.   He gives it to John. She gives it to him.   Is the apple red? The apples are red.   I must give it to him. I want to give it to her. I’m going to know tomorrow. (I have eaten the apple.)16 I can’t eat the apple.

- This is where helping verbs (auxiliary verbs) come in. Thank God. If I hadn’t discovered them, I never would have learned any languages. They’re the ultimate cheat. By memorizing a few verbs in a few tenses, you get access to all verbs. It opens up the entire language in a matter of 1–2 weeks. To illustrate, let’s look at simplified versions of my four primary sentences with Italian. Just notice that the verb (mangiare) doesn’t change: I must eat. → Ho bisogno di mangiare. I want to eat. → Voglio mangiare. I’m going to eat tomorrow. → Vado a mangiare domani. I can’t eat.→Non posso mangiare. [Literally: I am unable to eat.] All I need to memorize are the conjugations for a few verbs—to have, to want, to need, etc.—and I can slap the infinitive or to form of any other verb on the end (I want to eat, I’m going to read, I need to drink water, etc.).17 If you learn the auxiliary verbs in your target language, plus the all-important to be, to have, to do, and to go, you can very quickly express any idea.18 Just see the following chart.

- Here are some unusual combos to start with. Why do they work? Cinnamon and chile powder on vanilla ice cream. Olive oil on chocolate ice cream (bonus point: put an olive oil–fried sage leaf on top). Cinnamon on bacon. Almond butter on hamburger. Black pepper on watermelon. Mustard on black-eyed peas. Cinnamon on grilled pineapple (a favorite in churrascaria, grilled meat restaurants in Brazil (Location 1444)
- It's nearly impossible to show cause and effect with observational (versus experimental) data. (Location 2525)
