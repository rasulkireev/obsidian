## Highlights
- 2. Try to get fees on your cards waived. This can be a great way to optimize your credit cards, because your credit card companies will do all the work for you. Call them using the phone number on the back of the card and ask if you’re paying any fees, including annual fees or service charges. It should go a little something like this: You: Hi, I’d like to confirm that I’m not paying any fees on my credit card. Credit card rep: Well, it looks like you have an annual fee of $100. That’s actually one of our better rates. You: I’d rather pay no fees. Can you waive this year’s annual fee? Earlier I mentioned that it can be worth paying annual fees for rewards cards. This is true—but why not ask? Remember, credit card companies compete ferociously with each other, which can benefit you. Call them a month before your new annual fee kicks in and ask them to waive it. Sometimes it works, sometimes not. If you decide that your credit card fee isn’t worth it, ask your credit card company what they’ll do for you. If they waive your fees, great! If not, switch to a no-fee card. I suggest you do this at the same credit card company to simplify your life—and so you don’t have to close one account and open another, which will temporarily affect your credit score.

- 6. Use your credit card’s secret perks!Before I get into rewards programs, let me say this: Just like with car insurance, you can get great deals on your credit when you’re a responsible customer. In fact, there are lots of tips for people who have very good credit. If you fall in this category, you should call your credit cards and lenders once a year to ask them what advantages you’re eligible for. Often, they can waive fees, extend credit, and give you private promotions that others don’t have access to. Call them up and use this line: “Hi there. I checked my credit and noticed that I have a 750 credit score, which is pretty good. I’ve been a customer of yours for the last four years, so I’m wondering what special promotions and offers you have for me . . . I’m thinking of fee waivers and special offers that you use for customer retention.” (Location 967)

- One thing you want to pay attention to is picking the right dates for your transfers. This is key, but people often overlook it. If you set automatic transfers at weird times, it will inevitably necessitate more work. For example, if your credit card is due on the first of the month but you don’t get paid until the fifteenth, how does that work? If you don’t synchronize all your bills, you’ll have to pay things at different times and that will require you to reconcile accounts. Which you won’t do. The easiest way to avoid this is to get all your bills on the same schedule. To accomplish this, gather all your bills together, call the companies, and ask them to switch your billing dates. Most of these will take five minutes each to do (Location 3379)
- Pundits Worth Reading Here are three money columnists and one forum that I love. Morgan Housel writes one of the most interesting blogs on psychology and money out there. Read his posts to understand why you do what you do (and why the herd does what it does). collaborativefund.com/blog Dan Solin, author of a number of great investing books, writes a terrific newsletter where he names names and calls out the BS of the investing industry. Here are a few topics he’s tackled: “Cracks in the Robo-Advisor Facade,” “Active Fund Managers Are Losers,” and “Find the Courage to Be ‘Different.’ ” danielsolin.com Ron Lieber writes the Your Money column for the New York Times. I love the variety of topics he tackles, and he’s always pro-consumer. ronlieber.com Finally, I love the Bogleheads forum, where you can find good investing advice. They’ll steer you clear of scams and fads and refocus you on low-cost, long-term investing. bogleheads.org/forum (Location 3836)
