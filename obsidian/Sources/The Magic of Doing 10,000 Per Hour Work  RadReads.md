## Highlights
- Credit card hacking is a prime example of doing $10/hour work. It feels productive (free money!). It releases dopamine (A free flight upgrade!) And it makes you feel like you’re outfoxing a competitor (I got away with THIS!). But it fails to move the needle.
    - Note: Try to regularly ask yourself, if what you are doing is worth the time. Quite often, the answer is no.
