# The Mom Test
![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/default-book-icon-1.a08c56e2fedd.png)

## Metadata
- Author: [[Rob Fitzpatrick]]
- Full Title: The Mom Test

## Highlights
- When someone starts talking about what they “always” or “usually” or “never” or “would” do, they are giving you generic and hypothetical fluff. Follow The Mom Test and bring them back to specifics in the past. Ask when it last happened, for them to talk you through it, how they solved it, and what else they tried.  The world’s most deadly fluff is: “I would definitely buy that.” (Location 483)
- Rule of thumb: Ideas and feature requests should be understood, but not obeyed. (Location 644)
- Rule of thumb: If you’ve mentioned your idea, people will try to protect your feelings. (Location 669)
