## Highlights
- Ranking by Depth
  I’m going to go through and assign a score of 1 to 3 for depth to each topic on the list:
  1: Shorter, fun, one-off post. Probably < 1,000 words
  2: Somewhere in the middle, 1,000-2,000 word guides
  3: Massively useful in-depth guide on a topic, likely 2,000+ words
- With just 5-10 articles, you can easily reach 10k visitors a month. I currently get ~2,500 visitors per day from just 4 of my articles, so if just one of your articles reaches that level then you’ll have hit the goal.

- Step 5: Make a Schedule
  Before you start writing, create a schedule in Google Calendar for how often you’ll publish, both on your site and other sites.
  Aim for a minimum of two posts per month on your site, and one post a week on other sites. If you want to post more, put more time into posting on other sites. That’ll have a bigger ROI for you in the short term.
  But the most important thing is that once you make the schedule… stick to it. Lock it in, and make sure that you’re getting your articles out when you say you will. That’s the only way you succeed at this.
- Step 6: Create a List of Similar Blogs for Guest Posting
- You need a list of blogs that you can guest post on, and that you want to link back to you. The reason we’re doing this now is that once you have your list, you can include links to other people’s sites in your articles to earn good karma with them.

- Step 7: Write The First Article
- While writing it, I’d follow the guidelines for creating epic content that I give to writers for the Sumo blog:
  It must be actionable. Someone should be able to take the post and do something, not just go “oh that’s nice.”
  Focus on ONE core idea. Think of someone searching in Google. What question are they looking for the answer to, and why is your answer the best.
  Think of how you can make it the only article they need on the subject. When someone finds it they should go “whoa I better save this.”
  For length, think 1,500 - 4,000 words. More is fine if it’s kickass (this article is ~5,000). I find it’s hard to do a worthwhile topic justice with anything shorter.
  Use pictures. Make sure the pictures enhance the explanations--some fun photos are fine, but the point of the pictures should be to make whatever you’re saying more clear. No random stock photos.
  Chunk it up. It shouldn’t read like a New Yorker article. There should be helpful headings, sub headings, short paragraphs, bold text, etc.
  Links links links. Include any relevant links in your article. More links = more people we can email about plugging them in order to get them to share it.
  Link to my other articles. I can’t do this in the first one obviously, but for every article after that, this is important for SEO and for keeping people in the site.
- The best way to do this is through content upgrades. A content upgrade is any bonus piece of content that builds on what they’re getting for free, and is worth giving up their email address for.
  In this case, since the topic is different kinds of tea, I’d put together a 1-page PDF comparing their main differences of each kind of tea with nice visuals, and offer that to the readers, using the “10-minute content upgrades” method.
- Step 9: Promote Your Article
- 1. Email Your List
  I know you haven’t built a list yet, but secretly, you already have one.
  Huh?
  It’s all your friends. 
- 2. Post to Social
  I assume you have some Facebook friends.
  Post the article to Facebook, tag some people you think would be interested, and see what happens. You’d be surprised by how many of your friends might be interested in what you have to say.
  The same goes for Twitter, LinkedIn, and any other network you frequent.
- 3. Growth Hack Reddit
- Eddy wrote a great guide on getting tons of traffic from reddit, but the simple version is:
  Find a few subreddits that allow “link” posts
  Post your link there
  Ask a few friends to give you initial upvotes
- 4. Email Everyone You Mentioned
- Just say “hey I mentioned and linked to you in this post, here’s the link, have a good day.”
- 5. Submit to Other Relevant Communities
- Step 10. Create a List of Guest Topics
- The whole point of guest posting (for this strategy) is to build links back to yourself and increase your SEO ranking, so you want to write about things that let you easily link to yourself.
- Step 11. Start Guest Posting
- When writing the guest posts, make sure you do these things:
  Write really good articles. They shouldn’t be as good as the ones on your site (yeah yeah, I know, everyone else says the opposite, but they’re just saying that so you’ll give them your best content), but they should still be really good.
  Link to yourself tactfully. The point of the guest posts is to build more links back to yourself, so add in a few tactfully. No one wants a guest post with a dozen links that all go back to the author’s site, but no one will complain if you have a few.
  Get it to them ahead of schedule. As someone who manages a blog with a lot of guest posts, being early makes the editor love you forever. Most guest posters are flaky, get things in at the last minute, and make managing a blog a huge pain in the ass, so DON’T BE THAT GUY (or gal).
  Promote it. When you get published on another niche site (don’t worry about promoting it if it’s on Elite Daily, Huffington, etc.), promote it! They might not have a huge amount of traffic yet either so if you can get them some love they’ll want you to come back.
- Bonus Step 2: Make an Email Course
- In the case of Programming for Marketers, I have a site-wide email signup rate of ~15%, just using Welcome Mats and List Builders in all of our articles (in addition to the landing page).
  The easiest way to do this is just wait till you have ~5 great articles on your site under a certain theme, then package them into an autoresponder in MailChimp or another email marketing tool, and tell your visitors that they can (in this case) “Sign up to get 5 free lessons on become a tea master” or something similar.
