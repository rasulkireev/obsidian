- Full Title: Does Your Blog Need a Niche? Maybe Not
- URL: https://www.nateliason.com/blog/no-niche

## Highlights
- The point of most blogs is not to create good writing or to inform people as best as possible, but to sell things.
- Problem 1: Niches Lead to Content Fatigue
  The biggest problem with a focused blog is how quickly you will burn out your topics for good content. The only content worth writing is in-depth, useful articles that people can refer to for years to come, and when you pick a narrow niche, you will run out of those topics very quickly.
- By being free to jump around to multiple topics, I can provide more detailed, high information posts without burning my list of ideas out.
- Problem 2: You Might Get Bored
- But with a blog, the problem you’re ultimately solving is attention and interest, and the most effective way to maintain someone’s interest is through being interesting and irreplaceable. 
- Monetization is Harder
- You never know what will do well, so you have to keep experimenting.
- Since you have no niche, you can write about literally anything you want, and you should! You never know what sub-niches you’ll discover from experimenting.
- Your only promise is that you’ll be interesting, and you have to deliver that.
