## Highlights
- Instead of sharing a new idea, we keep it to ourselves because we’re afraid what people will think.
  There is no one way to apply more courage to your work.
  Maybe, for you, courage is choosing to work less because we are confident in our own productivity time. Even if that means having a 5-hour work day or 20 hour work week.
  Maybe it’s having a difficult conversation with someone at work.
  But, for all of us, being courageous is the real hard work we need to do, rather than just “clocking in more time.”
- “Use courage and wisdom, not labor, to make money.” — Nassim Taleb
