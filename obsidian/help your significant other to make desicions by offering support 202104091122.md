Chapter 22 - DON’T FORCE THE FEMININE TO MAKE DECISIONS

> As a practice, always help your woman make decisions by giving her your perspective and telling her your choices, while letting her know that you love her regardless of the decision she makes.

Doesn't that contradict with the title of the chapter?

Anyway, it does make sense to help you SO to make desicions by offering your thoughts, your options and letting her know that you accept any of their decision.

This thought is intuitive to me, but I always had one opposing thought. If [[you have a limited amount of will power during the day which depletes with every decision you make 202104091058]] how should you go about making the choice between deplpeting your own will power vs. helping your SO.
